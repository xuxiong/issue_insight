# Improve Code Readability Proposal

## Why
The current codebase has several readability issues that make it difficult to understand, maintain, and extend. Long functions, nested conditional logic, and mixed responsibilities in service classes create cognitive overhead for developers.

## What Changes
- **Break down long functions** (200+ lines in CLI main) into smaller, focused functions
- **Simplify complex conditional logic** by extracting helper functions
- **Improve function signatures** by reducing parameter counts and using data classes
- **Refactor mixed responsibilities** to follow single responsibility principle
- **Add clear documentation** and type hints for better code understanding

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: code-quality standards
- **Affected code**: src/cli/main.py, src/services/issue_analyzer.py, src/models/__init__.py
- **Testing**: No behavior changes, only structural improvements
- **Performance**: No impact on runtime performance
