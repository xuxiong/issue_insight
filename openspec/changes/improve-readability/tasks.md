# Code Readability Improvements - Tasks

## 1. Refactor CLI Main Function
- [ ] Extract argument validation logic into separate functions
- [ ] Break down the 200+ line `find_issues` function into smaller focused functions
- [ ] Extract output formatting logic into dedicated helpers
- [ ] Simplify error handling by creating reusable error handlers

## 2. Refactor IssueAnalyzer Service
- [ ] Break down the 300+ line `analyze_repository` method into smaller methods
- [ ] Extract progress tracking logic into dedicated methods
- [ ] Simplify the complex `_perform_analysis` method by extracting phase handlers
- [ ] Create helper methods for common operations (fetching, filtering, calculating metrics)

## 3. Improve Model Definitions
- [ ] Refactor duplicate validation logic between CLIArguments and FilterCriteria
- [ ] Simplify complex validators by extracting helper methods
- [ ] Add clearer documentation and type hints

## 4. General Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Remove unnecessary comments and add meaningful ones
- [ ] Verify code follows Python best practices
