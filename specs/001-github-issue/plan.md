# Implementation Plan: Enhanced GitHub Issue Filtering with Progress Display

**Branch**: `001-github-issue` | **Date**: 2025-10-14 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-github-issue/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the existing GitHub issue analysis tool with advanced filtering capabilities, robust pagination support for large repositories, and detailed progress display. This includes implementing comment count range filtering, comprehensive issue state/label/assignee/date filtering, and progress indicators for operations exceeding 2 seconds. The solution must handle up to 5000 issues within 30 seconds while maintaining memory usage under 200MB through streaming-first architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: PyGithub>=2.1.0, typer>=0.7.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, rich>=13.0.0, pytest>=7.4.0
**Storage**: N/A (stateless CLI tool)
**Testing**: pytest>=7.4.0 with integration, unit, and contract test coverage
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (CLI tool)
**Project Type**: Single-project Python CLI application
**Performance Goals**: Process 1000 issues in <10s (without comments), <30s (with comments); handle 5000 issues within 30s total; <200MB memory usage
**Constraints**: <200MB memory usage, <30s total processing time for 5000 issues, operations >2s must show progress, streaming-first for large datasets
**Scale/Scope**: Support repositories with up to 5000 issues including comment retrieval pagination

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### CLI-First Design ✅
- CLI commands use click framework with discoverable, self-documenting patterns
- Text I/O: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr
- Support for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, human-readable) already implemented

### Test-First Development ✅
- pytest framework configured with test structure in place
- Existing integration, unit, and contract test directories
- Need to implement TDD for new features

### Integration Testing Focus ✅
- GitHub API interactions already have integration test structure
- CLI command workflows can be tested end-to-end
- Contract tests required for enhanced pagination and filtering

### Performance by Design ✅
- <200MB memory constraint satisfied through streaming-first approach
- Progress indicators required for operations >2s (user requirement)
- 5000 issue support aligns with performance goals

### Simplicity & Maintainability ✅
- Single-responsibility principle maintained in existing codebase
- Dependencies are well-maintained (PyGithub, click, rich, pydantic)
- Clear separation between models, services, and CLI interface

**GATE STATUS: PASSED** - All constitution requirements satisfied

## Test-Driven Development Methodology

### Constitution Compliance
This project STRICTLY follows the **Test-First Development** principle from the constitution:

**Core TDD Rules**:
1. **Tests MUST be written FIRST and verified to FAIL**
2. **Implementation MUST be written ONLY to make tests pass**
3. **No code may be merged without corresponding passing tests**
4. **Each user story MUST have passing integration tests before completion**

### TDD Implementation Pattern

#### Foundation Phase (T005-1/T005-2 Pattern)
```bash
# Step 1: Write ALL failing tests first
T005-1 (Models Tests) → FAIL
T006-1 (GitHub Client Tests) → FAIL
T007-1 (Filter Engine Tests) → FAIL
T008-1 (Progress Tests) → FAIL
T009-1 (Error Tests) → FAIL
T010-1 (Validator Tests) → FAIL

# Step 2: Implement to make tests pass
T005-2 (Models Implementation) → PASS
T006-2 (GitHub Client Implementation) → PASS
# ... etc
```

#### User Story Phase (T011-T016 → T017-T019 Pattern)
```bash
# Step 1: Write comprehensive failing tests
T011-T016 (All US1 Tests) → VERIFIED TO FAIL

# Step 2: Implement just enough to pass tests
T017-T019 (US1 Implementation) → VERIFIED TO PASS
```

### Quality Gates
- **No tests, no implementation**
- **Failing test verification required**
- **90% test coverage for new code**
- **All integration tests must pass before story completion**

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- **Tests**: All test writing can be parallel (T005-1 to T010-1, T011-T016)
- **Implementation**: Can be parallel after all tests verified to fail
- **Cross-story**: After foundation complete, user stories can be parallel

**Structure Decision**: Aligned with tasks.md execution structure. The `src/cli/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/lib/` separation provides clean boundaries while supporting TDD methodology with independent testability. Each component has corresponding test files following the Test-First Development pattern.

## Implementation Phases and Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Tasks T001-T004)
**Objective**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, and development environment
**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete directory structure (`src/cli/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/lib/`, `tests/`)
- Virtual environment with dependencies
- CLI entry point with basic help
- Testing framework configuration

### Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (Tasks T005-1 to T010-2)
**Objective**: Implement core models, GitHub API client, and error handling using strict TDD
**TDD Structure**:
- Tests first (T005-1 to T010-1) - must FAIL
- Implementation second (T005-2 to T010-2) - make tests pass
**Key Deliverables**: Pydantic models, PyGithub client, filter engine, error handling

### Phase 3: User Story 1 - Project Activity Assessment (Tasks T011-T019)
**Core Value**: Filter GitHub issues by comment count with table output
**MVP Ready**: Basic functionality delivered in 25 total tasks

### Phase 4: User Story 2 - Community Hotspot Identification (Tasks T020-T025)
**Advanced Filtering**: Labels, states, assignees, dates

### Phase 5: User Story 3 - Activity Metrics and Trends (Tasks T026-T032)
**Analytics**: Aggregated metrics, trending analysis, time-based breakdowns

### Phase 6: User Story 4 - Comment Content Analysis (Tasks T033-T037)
**Deep Analysis**: Actual comment content retrieval with pagination

### Phase 7: User Story 5 - Formatted Output Options (Tasks T038-T041)
**Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, human-readable table formats

### Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (Tasks T042-T044)
**Production Ready**: Authentication, performance optimization, integration tests

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → [Phase 3-7 Parallel Possible] → Phase 8
```

### MVP Strategy: User Story 1 First
**Timeline**: 25 tasks total (4 setup + 12 foundation + 9 US1)
**Success Criteria**: Users can analyze repository activity within 2 minutes
