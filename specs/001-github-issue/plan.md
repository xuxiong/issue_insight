# Implementation Plan: Enhanced GitHub Issue Filtering with Progress Display

**Branch**: `001-github-issue` | **Date**: 2025-10-14 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-github-issue/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the existing GitHub issue analysis tool with advanced filtering capabilities, robust pagination support for large repositories, and detailed progress display. This includes implementing comment count range filtering, comprehensive issue state/label/assignee/date filtering, and progress indicators for operations exceeding 2 seconds. The solution must handle up to 5000 issues within 30 seconds while maintaining memory usage under 200MB through streaming-first architecture. Package management will use uv for improved performance and dependency resolution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: uv (package manager), PyGithub>=2.1.0, typer>=0.7.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, rich>=13.0.0, pytest>=7.4.0
**Storage**: N/A (stateless CLI tool)
**Testing**: pytest>=7.4.0 with integration, unit, and contract test coverage
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (CLI tool)
**Project Type**: Single-project Python CLI application managed with uv
**Performance Goals**: Process 1000 issues in <10s (without comments), <30s (with comments); handle 5000 issues within 30s total; <200MB memory usage
**Constraints**: <200MB memory usage, <30s total processing time for 5000 issues, operations >2s must show progress, streaming-first for large datasets
**Scale/Scope**: Support repositories with up to 5000 issues including comment retrieval pagination
**Limit Handling**: Apply limit principles per operation to minimize GitHub API calls and memory usage

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### CLI-First Design ✅
- CLI commands use typer framework with discoverable, self-documenting patterns
- Text I/O: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr
- Support for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, human-readable)

### Test-First Development ✅
- pytest framework configured with test structure in place
- Integration, unit, and contract test directories
- TDD methodology enforced throughout implementation

### Performance Standards ✅
- <200MB memory constraint satisfied through streaming-first approach
- Progress indicators required for operations >2s (user requirement)
- 5000 issue support aligns with performance goals (<30s total)

### CLI Usability ✅
- Error message standards defined in spec.md
- Help coverage requirement (100% command coverage)
- Actionable error messages for all failure scenarios

### Code Quality Standards ✅
- Type hints and documentation required for all public functions
- Code formatting with black, type checking with mypy
- CI/CD integration for automated quality checks

### Security Compliance ✅
- GitHub token handling via environment variable or CLI flag
- Rate limiting detection and graceful handling
- Input validation for repository URLs and filter parameters

## Limit Handling Principles

To minimize GitHub API calls and memory usage while maintaining performance requirements:

### API Call Optimization
- **Early Filtering**: Apply repository-level filters (state, labels, assignees) before fetching comments
- **Progressive Pagination**: Fetch issues in configurable batches (default: 100) with streaming processing
- **Comment Fetching Strategy**: Retrieve comments only for issues that pass all other filters
- **Rate Limit Awareness**: Monitor GitHub API rate limits and implement exponential backoff

### Memory Management
- **Streaming Processing**: Process issues as they arrive, don't accumulate full result sets in memory
- **Early Termination**: Stop fetching when user-specified `--limit` is reached
- **Comment Threshold**: Skip comment fetching for issues exceeding comment count filters early
- **Garbage Collection**: Explicit cleanup of processed issue data

### Performance Prioritization
1. **Metadata First**: Fetch only issue metadata (title, state, labels, assignees) in initial pass
2. **Conditional Comments**: Fetch comments only for issues that match primary filters
3. **Batch Processing**: Process issues in configurable batches to balance memory and API efficiency
4. **Progress Indicators**: Show meaningful progress at batch boundaries, not individual issues

### User Experience
- **Configurable Limits**: Default to 100 issue maximum unless explicitly increased by user
- **Clear Progress**: Show "Fetching issues (batch X/Y)" and "Processing issues (X/Y processed)"
- **Early Feedback**: Display initial results quickly while continuing to process
- **Interruption Support**: Allow graceful cancellation with partial results

**GATE STATUS: PASSED** - All constitution requirements satisfied

```

**Structure Decision**: Aligned with uv-based Python project management. The `src/cli/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/lib/` separation provides clean boundaries while supporting TDD methodology with independent testability. uv manages dependencies via pyproject.toml instead of requirements.txt for better performance and reproducible builds.

## Complexity Tracking

This project follows strict TDD methodology with no constitutional violations requiring complexity justification.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| (None) | TDD methodology ensures natural simplicity | Complexity managed through test-first approach |
