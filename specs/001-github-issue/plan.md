# Implementation Plan: Enhanced GitHub Issue Filtering with Progress Display

**Branch**: `001-github-issue` | **Date**: 2025-10-14 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-github-issue/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the existing GitHub issue analysis tool with advanced filtering capabilities, robust pagination support for large repositories, and detailed progress display. This includes implementing comment count range filtering, comprehensive issue state/label/assignee/date filtering, and progress indicators for operations exceeding 2 seconds. The solution must handle up to 5000 issues within 30 seconds while maintaining memory usage under 200MB through streaming-first architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: PyGithub>=2.1.0, click>=8.1.0, rich>=13.0.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, orjson>=3.9.0, requests>=2.31.0, tabulate>=0.9.0
**Storage**: N/A (stateless CLI tool)
**Testing**: pytest>=7.4.0 with integration, unit, and contract test coverage
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (CLI tool)
**Project Type**: Single-project Python CLI application
**Performance Goals**: Process 1000 issues in <10s (without comments), <30s (with comments); handle 5000 issues within 30s total; <200MB memory usage
**Constraints**: <200MB memory usage, <30s total processing time for 5000 issues, operations >2s must show progress, streaming-first for large datasets
**Scale/Scope**: Support repositories with up to 5000 issues including comment retrieval pagination

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### CLI-First Design ✅
- CLI commands use click framework with discoverable, self-documenting patterns
- Text I/O: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr
- Support for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, human-readable) already implemented

### Test-First Development ✅
- pytest framework configured with test structure in place
- Existing integration, unit, and contract test directories
- Need to implement TDD for new features

### Integration Testing Focus ✅
- GitHub API interactions already have integration test structure
- CLI command workflows can be tested end-to-end
- Contract tests required for enhanced pagination and filtering

### Performance by Design ✅
- <200MB memory constraint satisfied through streaming-first approach
- Progress indicators required for operations >2s (user requirement)
- 5000 issue support aligns with performance goals

### Simplicity & Maintainability ✅
- Single-responsibility principle maintained in existing codebase
- Dependencies are well-maintained (PyGithub, click, rich, pydantic)
- Clear separation between models, services, and CLI interface

**GATE STATUS: PASSED** - All constitution requirements satisfied

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project Python CLI application using the existing src/issue_finder structure. The current layout already follows best practices with clear separation between models (data structures), services (business logic), utils (helpers), and CLI interface. This structure supports the test-first development approach with dedicated test directories for different testing levels.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
