# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Project Activity Analyzer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified and resolved
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Comment content functionality properly specified
- [x] All critical ambiguities resolved through clarification process

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved through analysis and remediation.
- Private repository support has been explicitly excluded (FR-013) - scope limited to public repositories only.
- All critical ambiguities resolved, algorithms defined, and requirements made measurable.
