# Tasks: GitHub Project Activity Analyzer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-github-issue/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create Python package structure per implementation plan (src/issue_finder/, tests/, etc.)
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with pyproject.toml and Click 8.x dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Create requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt with research.md dependencies
- [x] T004 [P] Configure development tools (black, mypy, pre-commit hooks)
- [x] T005 Create .gitignore for Python project
- [x] T006 Create basic README.md with project description

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Comment Content Analysis (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to access actual comment content from filtered issues to understand specific topics, identify recurring themes, and analyze community sentiment.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 filtering but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses data from US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1/US2 with comment content, should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Affects all stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before CLI endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Integration test for basic comment filtering in tests/integration/test_cli_integration.py"
Task: "Unit test for GitHub client issue fetching in tests/unit/test_services.py"
Task: "Contract test for GitHub API endpoints in tests/contract/test_api_contracts.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create base models: GitHubRepository, User, Label in src/issue_finder/models/"
Task: "Create base Issue and Comment models in src/issue_finder/models/issue.py"
Task: "Create base FilterCriteria model in src/issue_finder/models/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1 - highest priority)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2 - community hotspots)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2 - metrics)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Later developers can pick up User Story 4 and 5

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## MVP Scope (User Story 1 Only)

**Minimal Viable Product**: Users can analyze GitHub repository issues by comment count with table output
- **Core features**: Comment filtering, basic table output, error handling
- **CLI command**: `issue-analyzer --min-comments 5 https://github.com/owner/repo`
- **Success criteria**: Returns filtered issues in table format with performance <30s

**Estimated tasks for MVP**: T001-T028 (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)
**Parallel opportunities**: Multiple tasks in each phase can be done simultaneously
