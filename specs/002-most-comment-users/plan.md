# Implementation Plan: Most Comment Users

**Branch**: `002-most-comment-users` | **Date**: 2025-10-20 | **Spec**: [specs/002-most-comment-users/spec.md](./specs/002-most-comment-users/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `./specs/002-most-comment-users/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the GitHub Project Activity Analyzer to identify and display the most active users based on comment count across all issues, integrating comment aggregation with existing issue creation metrics.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: PyGithub>=2.1.0, click>=8.1.0, rich>=13.0.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, orjson>=3.9.0, requests>=2.31.0, tabulate>=0.9.0
**Storage**: In-memory processing with JSON output
**Testing**: pytest with unit/integration/contract tests
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows CLI
**Project Type**: CLI tool
**Performance Goals**: Process up to 1000 issues with average 10 comments each within 30 seconds
**Constraints**: Must respect GitHub API rate limits, handle missing comment data gracefully
**Scale/Scope**: Analyze repositories with up to 1000 issues, display top 10 most active comment users by default

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### 1. Test-Driven Development (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - Feature will be developed test-first with failing tests before implementation
- **Evidence**: Following existing TDD patterns from 001-github-issue feature

### 2. Performance Standards (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - Performance goal aligns with constitution (30 seconds for typical repositories)
- **Evidence**: Spec requires processing up to 1000 issues with average 10 comments within reasonable time

### 3. CLI Usability (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - Feature extends existing CLI interface maintaining discoverability
- **Evidence**: Integrates with existing CLI patterns, includes help text and error handling

### 4. Code Quality Standards (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - Uses existing Python 3.11+ codebase with type hints and documentation
- **Evidence**: Follows existing code standards (black, mypy, ruff)

### 5. Security Compliance (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - No new security concerns introduced
- **Evidence**: Uses existing GitHub API client with rate limiting and token handling

### 6. Output Formatting Standards (MUST)
- **Status**: PASS - Uses Rich library for table output as specified in requirements
- **Evidence**: FR-007 requires table format using Rich library

**Structure Decision**: Single project CLI structure maintained as existing codebase already follows this pattern.
