# Project Constitution: GitHub Project Activity Analyzer

## Purpose
This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles and quality standards that MUST be followed during all phases of the GitHub Project Activity Analyzer project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (MUST)
- **Principle**: All functional code MUST be developed test-first
- **Implementation**: Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation code
- **Verification**: Each user story MUST have passing integration tests before completion
- **Quality Gate**: No code may be merged without corresponding passing tests

### 2. Performance Standards (MUST)
- **Principle**: CLI tool MUST respond within 30 seconds for typical repositories
- **Implementation**: Performance testing MUST be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Verification**: Automated performance regression tests MUST run on every commit
- **Quality Gate**: Any performance regression >10% MUST be addressed before merge

### 3. CLI Usability (MUST)
- **Principle**: CLI MUST be discoverable and error-proof
- **Implementation**:
  - Help text MUST be available for all commands (`--help`)
  - Error messages MUST be actionable and suggest fixes
  - Command structure MUST follow common CLI patterns
- **Verification**:
  - New user usability test (first-time use <2 minutes)
  - Help completeness check (100% command coverage)
  - Error actionability test (100% of errors suggest solution)
- **Quality Gate**: CLI usability validation MUST pass before release

### 4. Code Quality Standards (MUST)
- **Principle**: Code MUST maintain high quality and readability
- **Implementation**:
  - Type hints REQUIRED for all function signatures
  - Documentation strings REQUIRED for all public functions
  - Code formatting MUST use project standards (black, mypy)
- **Verification**: Automated linting and type checking in CI
- **Quality Gate**: No code may pass CI with linting or type errors

### 5. Security Compliance (MUST)
- **Principle**: User credentials and data MUST be protected
- **Implementation**:
  - API tokens MUST be stored securely (never logged)
  - Rate limiting MUST be respected and handled gracefully
  - Input validation MUST prevent injection attacks
- **Verification**: Security review for authentication and data handling
- **Quality Gate**: Security review MUST pass before merge

## Amendment Process
- Changes to this constitution require unanimous team agreement
- Amendments MUST be made in separate pull requests with clear justification
- All existing code MUST be updated to comply within 2 weeks of constitution change

## Compliance Checklist
Each pull request MUST validate:
- [ ] Tests written and failing before implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] CLI help coverage complete
- [ ] Code formatting and type checking pass
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
