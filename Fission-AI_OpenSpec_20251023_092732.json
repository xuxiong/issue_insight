      "title": "Changes show as \"Untitled Change\" when following official proposal template",
      "body": "TL;DR when running `openspec show [change-id] --json --deltas-only`, I get title as \"Untitled Change\" because the change template doesn't include a title by default. \n\n```\n$ openspec show update-game-rules-codenames-compliance --json --deltas-only\nWarning: Ignoring flags not applicable to change: scenarios\n{\n  \"id\": \"update-game-rules-codenames-compliance\",\n  \"title\": \"Untitled Change\",\n  \"deltaCount\": 0,\n  \"deltas\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Description\n\nWhen users create change proposals following the official AGENTS.md template, the\nopenspec show command displays \"Untitled Change\" instead of the actual change title.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Initialize OpenSpec: openspec init\n2. Create a proposal following the template in AGENTS.md (without title header)\n3. Run: openspec show <change-id> --json --deltas-only\n4. Observe: \"title\": \"Untitled Change\"\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe issue is a mismatch between the proposal template and the title extraction logic:\n\nTemplate location: `src/core/templates/agents-template.ts` (lines ~159-177) The template\nshows this proposal structure:\n\n```\n## Why\n[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]\n\n## What Changes\n- [Bullet list of changes]\n- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]\n\n## Impact\n- Affected specs: [list capabilities]\n- Affected code: [key files/systems]\n```\n\nCode location: `src/commands/change.ts` (line ~122) The extractTitle function expects:\n\n```\nprivate extractTitle(content: string): string {\n  const match = content.match(/^#\\s+(?:Change:\\s+)?(.+)$/m);\n  return match ? match[1].trim() : 'Untitled Change';\n}\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nChanges should display their actual title instead of \"Untitled Change\" when users follow\nthe official template.\n\n### Proposed Fix\n\nUpdate the proposal template in `agents-template.ts` to include the required title header:\n\n```\n# Change: [Name of change]\n\n## Why\n[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]\n\n## What Changes\n- [Bullet list of changes]\n- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]\n\n## Impact\n- Affected specs: [list capabilities]\n- Affected code: [key files/systems]\n```\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n1. Update extractTitle to generate a title from the change ID if no header is found\n2. Make the title header optional and display the change directory name as fallback\n\n### Impact\n\n\u2022 Severity: Medium (UX issue, doesn't break functionality)\n\u2022 Scope: Template update only, no breaking changes\n\u2022 Users affected: All new OpenSpec users following the official template\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe regex supports both # Title and # Change: Title formats, but the template doesn't\ninclude either, causing the fallback to \"Untitled Change\".",

      "body": "I have been using openspec on a very simple task and while the framework of the program is very good, I strongly believe that task progress tracking should be implemented as an internal command that can be updated.\n\ni've had to terminate my llm at several points in the middle of completing a subtask and when it comes back, the regex in the program won't pick it up or will rewrite the spec progress because it correctly identifies that it was in the middle of a task. I'm using a local model, and this program does a really good job of being a little flexible so that it can plug into my toolchain whereas something like Task Master is very rigid and depends largely on frontier APIs and built in websearch capabilities.\n\nif the task management were moved to a specific CLI command like [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) I think it would benefit the program greatly. thanks!",

          "body": "Yeah I agree the experience isn't reliable here. The main issue here though is that we track tasks in .md files to make it easy to read and edit but its not so great as a structured data store that can be consistently modified or updated.\n\n It's easier for taskmaster as they store things in a .json file which is great for task management but not so great for readability.\n\nThe other tricky part here is marking tasks as complete as they go isn't great for agents sometimes as it deters their core focus from actually implementing the task. I did have some instruction previously that told the agent to tick things off as they go, but a lot of times the agents would usually ignore this part.\n\nExposing a cli command here could help, creating this sort of command to mark a checkbox in md as complete is tricky though. \nIt's a tradeoff between readability for humans vs a more structured data support.\n\nI'll have a think if there's other ways around this but the goal here was to create a very lightweight framework that can be managed through markdowns and viewable and editable in your editor itself but this obviously comes with some downsides.",

Slash commands for me are useful for doing a stage of the workflow and usually involve running multiple steps of instructions.\n\nAdding every single cli command just isn't worth it. It adds clutter to the slash commands and provides very little benefit. Especially when it's more deterministic things like listing active changes or validating.",

      "body": "I had an issue today with Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Claude Code) where it would repeatedly get things wrong in terms of formatting proposal, tasks, and spec files. I asked it why, and this is what it said (and it does make sense thinking about the prompt):\n\n```\n  The issue: The slash command instructions (/openspec:proposal) said:\n\n  \"Refer to openspec/AGENTS.md ... if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications\"\n\n  I interpreted \"if you need\" as optional - only check it when stuck. So I:\n  1. Created files based on general knowledge of what proposals/tasks/specs look like\n  2. Hit validation errors\n  3. Then read AGENTS.md and had to iterate back to the correct format\n\n  The root cause: The instruction phrasing made AGENTS.md sound like a fallback reference, not a mandatory template to follow from step one. I\n   should have read it before creating files, but the workflow didn't make that explicit.\n\n  How to prevent it:\n\n  1. Change the slash command instructions to be more prescriptive:\n    - Instead of: \"Refer to AGENTS.md if you need clarifications\"\n    - Say: \"First read the templates in AGENTS.md lines 162-204, then create files matching those exact formats\"\n  2. Add an explicit step like:\n  0. Read AGENTS.md sections on proposal.md (lines 162-174), tasks.md (lines 197-204),\n     and spec.md (lines 236-286) to understand required formats\n  3. Make me more defensive: Even with the current phrasing, I should have proactively read the templates first. The instructions did say to\n  review context first - I should have treated AGENTS.md as part of that mandatory context review.\n```\n\nI would suggest updating the prompts to make reading OpenSpec conventions a mandatory step rather than implying it is optional.\nNot the end of the world as the agent did in the end get it right due to validation, but it wasted time and tokens.",

However, when I switched to another project, I couldn't access the comments.\n\nIt seems OpenSpec only created comments for the first project. When I tried to initiate OpenSpec in the new project, it used the configuration from the previous project because the current directory doesn't have an .openspec folder. As a result, the comments didn't appear, and there doesn't seem to be a way to force OpenSpec to initialize for the new directory.\n\nTo fix this, I had to manually copy the .openspec folder from the first project into the new project's folder.\n\nThanks",

      "title": "Bug: Archive validation fails despite requirement headers containing SHALL/MUST",
      "body": "# Bug Report: Archive Validation Fails Despite Requirement Headers Containing SHALL/MUST\n\n## Description\n\nThe `openspec archive` command validation incorrectly rejects requirement headers that contain \"SHALL\" or \"MUST\" keywords, even when these keywords are explicitly present in the requirement header text.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OpenSpec Version**: 0.9.2\n- **Node.js Version**: 22 LTS\n- **OS**: macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)\n- **Project**: ideator\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a requirement header contains \"SHALL\" or \"MUST\" (e.g., `### Requirement: Circuit Breaker State Management SHALL be implemented`), the validation should pass and allow archiving.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe validation rejects the header with the error:\n```\n\u2717 ADDED \"Circuit Breaker State Management SHALL be implemented\" must contain SHALL or MUST\n```\n\nThe error message literally shows the header **contains \"SHALL\"**, yet claims it doesn't contain SHALL or MUST.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create an OpenSpec change with delta specs\n2. Add requirement headers with SHALL/MUST keywords:\n   ```markdown\n   ## ADDED Requirements\n\n   ### Requirement: Circuit Breaker State Management SHALL be implemented\n   **ID**: REQ-CB-001\n   **Priority**: P1 (High)\n\n   The system MUST implement a circuit breaker with three states.\n\n   #### Scenario: Normal operation\n   **Given** the circuit breaker is in CLOSED state\n   **When** a request is made\n   **Then** the request is executed normally\n   ```\n3. Run `openspec validate [change-id] --strict`\n4. Observe validation error despite SHALL being present\n5. Try to archive: `openspec archive [change-id] --yes`\n6. Same validation error blocks archiving\n\n## Attempted Workarounds\n\n### \u274c Using `--no-validate` flag\n```bash\nopenspec archive prevent-application-crashes --yes --no-validate\n```\n**Result**: Still enforces validation despite the flag, same errors appear\n\n### \u274c Using `--skip-specs` flag\n```bash\nopenspec archive prevent-application-crashes --yes --skip-specs\n```\n**Result**: Still enforces validation, same errors appear\n\n### \u2705 Manual archive (workaround used)\n```bash\nmkdir -p openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[change-id]\ncp -r openspec/changes/[change-id]/* openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[change-id]/\nrm -rf openspec/changes/[change-id]\n```\n\n## Validation Examples\n\nAll 27 requirement headers in our change contain SHALL or MUST:\n\n**Circuit Breaker Spec** (5 requirements):\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Circuit Breaker State Management SHALL be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: AI Service MUST have Circuit Breaker`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Redis MUST have Circuit Breaker`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Circuit Breaker Configuration MUST be provided`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Circuit Breaker Monitoring MUST be implemented`\n\n**Frontend Error Handlers Spec** (5 requirements):\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Window Error Handler MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Unhandled Promise Rejection Handler MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Integration with React Error Boundary MUST be provided`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Error Reporting Service Integration MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: User Feedback for Errors MUST be provided`\n\n**Health Monitoring Spec** (8 requirements):\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Liveness Probe MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Readiness Probe MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Detailed Health Check MUST be provided`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Database Health Check MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Redis Health Check MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: AI Service Health Check MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Memory Health Check MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Health Check Caching MUST be implemented`\n\n**Process Error Handlers Spec** (4 requirements):\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Uncaught Exception Handler MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Unhandled Promise Rejection Handler MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Error Logging Integration MUST be provided`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Non-Terminating Behavior MUST be ensured`\n\n**Service Error Boundaries Spec** (5 requirements):\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Service Error Boundary Wrapper MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Error Normalization in Services MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Critical Service Operations MUST have fallback`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Service Operation Context Tracking MUST be implemented`\n- \u2705 `### Requirement: Retry Logic for Transient Failures MUST be implemented`\n\n**All 27 headers contain SHALL or MUST**, yet validation rejects all of them.\n\n## Full Validation Output\n\n```bash\n$ openspec archive prevent-application-crashes --yes\n\nProposal warnings in proposal.md (non-blocking):\n  \u26a0 Change must have a Why section.

Please fix the errors before archiving.\nTo skip validation (not recommended), use --no-validate flag.\n```\n\n## Suspected Root Cause\n\nThe validation regex or parsing logic appears to be checking the **wrong part** of the requirement. Possible issues:\n\n1. **Checking first line of requirement body instead of header**: The validator might be looking at the first sentence after the header (e.g., \"The system MUST...\") instead of the header itself.\n\n2. **Regex not matching the full header**: The regex might only match `### Requirement: [Text]` without the SHALL/MUST suffix, or might be checking a substring that doesn't include the keywords.\n\n3. **Case sensitivity**: Though unlikely since we're using uppercase SHALL/MUST as recommended.\n\n4. **Parsing error**: The header parsing might be stopping before the SHALL/MUST keywords.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nCheck the validation code that tests for SHALL/MUST in requirement headers. The regex should match patterns like:\n\n```javascript\n// Correct pattern should match:\n/###\\s+Requirement:\\s+.*?\\b(SHALL|MUST)\\b/i\n```\n\nEnsure the validation is checking the **entire header line** (from `###` to end of line), not just the first few words.\n\n## Documentation Reference\n\nAccording to `openspec/AGENTS.md` line 257:\n> Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)\n\nThis guidance seems to suggest SHALL/MUST should appear in the requirement **text** (first sentence), not necessarily the **header**. However, the validation error suggests the **header** must contain these keywords.\n\n**Recommendation**: Either:\n1. Fix the validation to check requirement text instead of header, OR\n2. Update documentation to clarify SHALL/MUST must be in header, OR\n3. Make the validation configurable/optional for this rule\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High - Blocks legitimate changes from being archived\n- **Workaround**: Manual archive required (breaking automation workflows)\n- **User Experience**: Confusing error message showing the keywords exist but claiming they don't\n- **Documentation**: Creates confusion about where SHALL/MUST should appear\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis bug prevented us from archiving a production-ready change with:\n- 9 files created (2,328 lines of code)\n- 5 files modified\n- 68 comprehensive tests\n- 5 capability specifications\n- Full implementation of critical error handling features\n\nThe implementation was complete and tested, but the tooling bug forced us to manually archive.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Short-term**: Fix regex to correctly detect SHALL/MUST in headers\n2. **Medium-term**: Make `--no-validate` flag actually skip validation as documented\n3. **Long-term**: Improve error messages to show exactly where validation is checking and what it found\n\n## Test Case\n\nCreate a minimal test case:\n\n```markdown\n# openspec/changes/test-validation/specs/test/spec.md\n\n## ADDED Requirements\n\n### Requirement: Test Feature MUST be implemented\n**ID**: REQ-TEST-001\n**Priority**: P1\n\nThe system MUST implement a test feature.\n\n#### Scenario: Test scenario\n**Given** a condition\n**When** an action occurs\n**Then** a result happens\n```\n\nRun validation:\n```bash\nopenspec validate test-validation --strict\n```\n\nExpected: Validation passes\nActual: Validation fails with \"must contain SHALL or MUST\" despite SHALL/MUST being present\n\n---\n\n## Related\n\n- OpenSpec version: 0.9.2\n- Project: ideator\n- Change ID: prevent-application-crashes (successfully implemented but blocked from archiving)\n",

      "body": "## Description\nWhen using slash commands like `/openspec-apply add-switchable-admin-agents`, the command arguments are not being properly passed to the template files in `.opencode/command/`. \n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Command: `/openspec-apply add-switchable-admin-agents`\n- Template placeholder `<id>` should be replaced with `add-switchable-admin-agents`\n- Result should reference: `changes/add-switchable-admin-agents/proposal.md`\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Template placeholder `<id>` is being replaced with a default/cached value: `0042-blog-footer-enhancement`\n- Result incorrectly references: `changes/0042-blog-footer-enhancement/proposal.md`\n- This causes \"ENOENT: no such file or directory\" errors\n\n## Investigation\nThe template at `.opencode/command/openspec-apply.md` contains correct placeholders like `changes/<id>/proposal.md`, but the command processing system is not substituting the actual command argument for the `<id>` placeholder.\n\n## Environment\n- OpenSpec CLI version: (latest)\n- Platform: Linux\n- Command used: `/openspec-apply add-switchable-admin-agents`\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have a valid change like `add-switchable-admin-agents` in `openspec/changes/`\n2. Run `/openspec-apply add-switchable-admin-agents`\n3. Observe that the generated instruction references `0042-blog-footer-enhancement` instead of `add-switchable-admin-agents`\n4. Error occurs when trying to read non-existent directory\n\nThis appears to be a bug in the command argument parsing or variable substitution system.",

Check what specs can be archived by using shell or bash and run the command `openspec list` to find the id available for archive.\n\n### Validation Failed\n\n3. If the id of the user is not among the list to be found, cancel the process. Cancel the request and tell the user why. Do not continue, do not just take any other id. YOU MUST STOP the process. \n\n### Validation Succeeded - ID provided by the user matches an id from the list\n\n4. Run `openspec archive <id> --yes` to let the CLI move the change and apply spec updates without prompts (use `--skip-specs` only for tooling-only work). \n5. Review the command output to confirm the target specs were updated and the change landed in `changes/archive/`. \n6. Validate with `openspec validate --strict` and inspect with `openspec show <id>` if anything looks off.\n\n**Reference**\n- Inspect refreshed specs with `openspec list --specs` and address any validation issues before handing off.\n<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->\n\n```\n\nNot sure if it desired for me to add this to the repo.",

          "body": "@TabishB ... thanks for the quick reply. Trying to get the spec deltas and using the command for that was the correct approach to take.\n\nHere is what happened:\n- The proposal.md was missing the critical \"Why\" and \"What changes\" headline ... the file itself was existing and had very cool and the right info but not in the required format. Furthermore i did recognize that the tasks.md did not have checkboxes as in the screenshot of the docs.\n\n> Suggestion: The error provided in the validate was a bit misleading, could be changed to be more laser focused. \n\nThat means while the files existed and had somewhat the right content, they did not have the correct structure expected by the parsers.\n\nI was able to nail down the issue to the way opencode was dealing with openspec - it seems it was not reading the openspec/AGENTS.md properly \n\nFor the solution i had to create an additional primary agent in opencode. I called it openspec-planner.md ... in this agent i defined the openspec/AGENTS.md to be loaded ... something like this:\n\n``` \n---\ndescription: \"Executes Proposal Creation Task of OpenSpec\"\nmode: primary\nmodel: lmstudio/gpt-oss-120b\ntemperature: 0.4\ntools:\n  read: true\n  grep: true\n  glob: true\n  edit: true\n  write: true\n  bash: true\n  oi-mcp: true\n  playwright-mcp: false\n  chrome-devtools: false\n  laravel-boost: true\n  context7: true\n  brave-search: true\n  serena: true\npermissions:\n  bash:\n    \"rm -rf *\": \"ask\"\n    \"sudo *\": \"deny\"\n  edit:\n    \"**/*.env*\": \"deny\"\n    \"**/*.key\": \"deny\"\n    \"**/*.secret\": \"deny\"\n---\n\n# Open Spec Planer Agent\n\nFollow the instructions given in the command precisely. \nOnly create the specs and a plan. You are allowed to create the spec files.\nDo not implement anything. Do not code.\n\nDo not read anything in the openspec/changes/archive folder.\n\nMake sure you are aware of ```@openspec/AGENTS.md``` you must follow these instructions precisely to the point otherwise you will fail. There is no room for error. Read this file before you start with your task.\n\n## Notes:\nThe openspec shell command needs to be run on host, not in lando / container.\n```\n\nThis basically fixed the issue. The command /openspec-proposal now executing this agent with additional instructions created all the files correctly.\n\nLong story short ... it might be handy to use a dedicated agent with some extra opencode specific commands to make it work while keeping the main AGENTS.md to be like the original.\n\nI wonder how this could be set up automatically in the openspec init process (or added to the opencode specific docs in openspec) and if i could be of any help.",

It's a pain myself and a few others have felt as well. \n\nCreating a new proposal for a tweak usually feels too bulky and sometimes you tweak things during implementation that makes the initial proposed spec invalid. There's currently no good way or step in the process yet to handle this without explicitly or manually updating the proposal and proposed specs etc.\n\n\nThere's probably two approaches we can possibly take here.\n\n1) Forcing a spec check before during every iteration. Such that everytime you provide feedback it verifies or modifies if anything needs to change in the proposal, thus preemptively updating the proposal before any feedback is applied.\n\nPros: Maintains the spec-first approach,\nCons: Quite a bit of overhead and having to check each time whether spec needs to be updated. Harder to manage context session with this as well.\n\n\n2) Have some sort of finalization step. Start with initial proposal, then provide feedback as you need. Then at the end finalize the proposal and modify specs as needed.\n\nPros: Easier and faster to iterate.\nCons: Finalizing would most likely be manual and something you have to remember. Maybe not as robust and things can be missing in the finalized approach at this stage.",

I guess the problem with this approach is that specs are not always a 100% clear and reality might give you new insights, requiring a feedback loop _after_ applying the spec.\n2.

I see the tricky part, so use SPACE to confirm selection first, and then use ENTER to proceed. \n\nNow it's working, thanks so much. @TabishB consideration to add some instructure for anyone else to void this easy overlook. or think something like making a YouTube video to demo the basics. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nBTW, init doesn't create any slash commands like Spec-kit, right?\n\nI will keep this for another day incase someone need to see. and then I will close it.

          "body": "Hey @kurdin \n\n> I find the main AGENTS.md and OpenSpec's project.md in my case are very similar\n\nKeep in mind that for tools that use `AGENTS.md` the root agents file here is ALWAYS sent during every new chat request. If you're documenting project structure here instead of just rules the question I would have is do these need to be sent alongside every request?\n\n> Another thing that I would change: I would rename @/openspec/AGENTS.md to @/openspec/OPENSPEC.md\n\nThe current naming is very intentionally done. This actually just used to be called `/openspec/README.md` but once the [agents.md](https://agents.md/) standard was agreed upon this was updated. \n\nthe /openspec folder is meant to be it's own little module and the `/openspec/AGENTS.md` file serves as instructions for agents when using that folder when doing things related to openspec.\n\nTake a look at point 4 on the agents.md website itself on using nested agents.md files. Some openai repos have some good examples of this pattern being used too.\n\n> openspec delete [change-name]\n\nyep agreed on this, I think this would complete the cli a bit more\n\n> openspec progress [change-name] (show what is done and what is not for the feature/change-name)\n\nYeah I think this or something similar would be good too. The `openspec list --changes` could be a decent substitute if you want to view just the task status albeit it shows you for all changes not a specific one.\n\n> You can ask the LLM to do that even without the /openspec command, but I think it would be better to provide better guidance to the LLM on how to deal with those requests.\n\nI like the idea of refine! merge is interesting too (I was actually thinking the opposite as well where you maybe want to split a big proposal into smaller ones)\n\nDelete and progress I'd maybe be a little wary to add. Just because I want to keep the amount of slash commands limited as users get overwhelmed when a project has too many commands. I think there needs to be a certain level of complexity for a task for it to be a slash command, hence why I like the idea of merge/expand being slash commands but progress and deletion probably dosent require one.\n\nFeel free to post feedback anywhere haha, not too fussed if its in issues or in the discussions or even the discord :) \n \n\n",

When I asked CC to create new task for `enhance-qr-save-workflow` using opespec, it did not create task in the `www.qr-platform/openspec/src/layouts/components/tools/QRGenerator` folder but in the root or the project in the `www.qr-platform/openspec/changes/enhance-qr-save-workflow` folder. \n\n<img width=\"1139\" height=\"453\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/352e87a0-f5cf-4369-8866-4be3929c4bd1\" />\n\nafter I manually moved all task's related files to the local tool's folder, after that I can see all its tasks and progress.

I don't think this is related to `openspec` maybe LLM did not understand it correctly what location of openspec folder should it use. \n\n~/Documents/projects/qr-platform/www.qr-platform/src/layouts/components/tools/QRGenerator (saved-qr-code-modal-to-save-restore-generated-qr)\n\n$ openspec view\n\nOpenSpec Dashboard\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nSummary:\n  \u25cf Specifications: 0 specs, 0 requirements\n  \u25cf Active Changes: 4 in progress\n  \u25cf Completed Changes: 0\n  \u25cf Task Progress: 153/292 (52% complete)\n\nActive Changes\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  \u25c9 add-qr-history-gallery         [\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591] 0%\n  \u25c9 refine-qr-history-ux           [\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591] 0%\n  \u25c9 enhance-qr-save-workflow       [\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591\u2591] 88%\n  \u25c9 fix-favorites-custom-color-reset [\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591] 96%\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\nBut yeah, I think, some kind of multi folders flow should be supported for openspec in that case you can support monorepos or multi tools projects much better.

First ask clarifying questions to ensure complete understanding of task requirements and background\n2. Analyze task complexity and scope, identifying main functional modules or work packages\n3. Break down tasks into 3-4 main phases, each containing specific subtasks\n4. Define clear inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria for each subtask, as well as files that may need modification.

Ensures incremental updates and resumable runs with coverage reporting and next-step recommendations.\n\n## I. General Constraints\n\n- Do not modify source code; only generate/update documentation and `.claude/index.json`.\n- **Ignore Rules Retrieval Strategy**:\n  1. Prioritize reading the `.gitignore` file from the project root directory\n  2. If `.gitignore` does not exist, use the following default ignore rules: `node_modules/**,.git/**,.github/**,dist/**,build/**,.next/**,__pycache__/**,*.lock,*.log,*.bin,*.pdf,*.png,*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.gif,*.mp4,*.zip,*.tar,*.gz`\n  3. Merge ignore patterns from `.gitignore` with default rules\n- For large files/binaries, only record paths without reading content.\n\n## II. Staged Strategy (Automatic Intensity Selection)\n\n1. **Stage A: Repository Census (Lightweight)**\n   - Use multiple `Glob` calls in batches to get file inventory (avoid single-call limits), doing:\n     - File counting, language proportions, directory topology, module candidate discovery (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, apps/_, packages/_, services/_, cmd/_, etc.).\n   - Generate `Module Candidate List`, annotating each candidate module with: language, entry file guesses, test directory existence, config file existence.\n2. **Stage B: Module Priority Scanning (Medium)**\n   - For each module, try reading in the following order (batched, paginated):\n     - Entry and startup: `main.ts`/`index.ts`/`cmd/*/main.go`/`app.py`/`src/main.rs`, etc.\n     - External interfaces: routes, controllers, API definitions, proto/openapi\n     - Dependencies and scripts: `package.json scripts`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, config directories\n     - Data layer: `schema.sql`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, ORM models, migration directories\n     - Testing: `tests/**`, `__tests__/**`, `*_test.go`, `*.spec.ts`, etc.\n     - Quality tools: `eslint/ruff/golangci` configurations\n   - Form \"module snapshots\", extracting only high-signal fragments and paths, not pasting large code blocks.\n3. **Stage C: Deep Supplementation (Triggered As Needed)**\n   - Trigger conditions (any one suffices):\n     - Repository overall small (fewer files) or single module small file count;\n     - After Stage B, still cannot determine key interfaces/data models/testing strategies;\n     - Root or module `CLAUDE.md` missing information items.\n   - Action: **Additional paginated reading** for target directories, filling gaps.\n\n> Note: If pagination/attempts reach tool or time limits, must **write partial results early** and explain in summary \"why stopped here\" and \"next-step recommended directory list\".\n\n## III. Artifacts and Incremental Updates\n\n1.  **Write Root-level `CLAUDE.md`**\n    - If exists, insert/update `Change Log (Changelog)` at the top.\n    - Root structure (concise yet global):\n      - Project Vision\n      - Architecture Overview\n      - **\u2728 New: Module Structure Diagram (Mermaid)**\n        - Above the \"Module Index\" table, generate a Mermaid `graph TD` tree diagram based on identified module paths.\n        - Each node should be clickable and link to the corresponding module's `CLAUDE.md` file.\n        - Example syntax:\n\n          ```mermaid\n          graph TD\n              A[\"(Root) My Project\"] --> B[\"packages\"];\n              B --> C[\"auth\"];\n              B --> D[\"ui-library\"];\n              A --> E[\"services\"];\n              E --> F[\"audit-log\"];\n\n              click C \"./packages/auth/CLAUDE.md\" \"View auth module docs\"\n              click D \"./packages/ui-library/CLAUDE.md\" \"View ui-library module docs\"\n              click F \"./services/audit-log/CLAUDE.md\" \"View audit-log module docs\"\n          ```\n\n      - Module Index (table format)\n      - Running and Development\n      - Testing Strategy\n      - Coding Standards\n      - AI Usage Guidelines\n      - Change Log (Changelog)\n\n2.  **Write Module-level `CLAUDE.md`**\n    - Place in each module directory, suggested structure:\n      - **\u2728 New: Relative Path Breadcrumbs**\n        - At the **top** of each module `CLAUDE.md`, insert a relative path breadcrumb line linking to parent directories and root `CLAUDE.md`.\n        - Example (located at `packages/auth/CLAUDE.md`): `[Root Directory](../../CLAUDE.md) > [packages](../) > **auth**`\n      - Module Responsibilities\n      - Entry and Startup\n      - External Interfaces\n      - Key Dependencies and Configuration\n      - Data Models\n      - Testing and Quality\n      - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n      - Related File List\n      - Change Log (Changelog)\n3.  **`.claude/index.json`**\n    - Record: current timestamp (provided via parameters), root/module lists, entry/interface/test/important paths for each module, **scan coverage**, ignore statistics, whether truncated due to limits (`truncated: true`).\n\n## IV. Coverage and Resumability\n\n- Calculate and print each run:\n  - Estimated total files, scanned file count, coverage percentage;\n  - Coverage summary and gaps for each module (missing interfaces, tests, data models, etc.);\n  - Top ignored/skipped directories and reasons (ignore rules/large files/time or call limits).\n- Write \"gap list\" to `index.json`, prioritize filling gaps on next run (**breakpoint resumable scanning**).\n\n## V. Result Summary (Print to Main Dialog)\n\n- Root/module `CLAUDE.md` creation or update status;\n- Module list (path + one-sentence responsibility);\n- Coverage and major gaps;\n- If not fully read: explain \"why stopped here\" and list **recommended next steps** (e.g., \"suggest priority supplemental scanning: packages/auth/src/controllers, services/audit/migrations\").\n\n## VI. Time Format and Usage\n\n- Use relative paths;\n- Time information: Use the timestamp provided via command parameters and write in ISO-8601 format in `index.json`.\n- Do not manually write time information; use the provided timestamp parameter to ensure time accuracy.\nThis plan looks good",

Most of the time agent uses # MODIFIED even if that requirement doesnt exists on existing specs hence i get validation errors when trying to archive the spec.\n\nMaybe a clearer guideline on when to use # MODIFIED and # ADDED especially after the initial \"openspec change proposal creation\" since i always have spec update along the way, maybe it doesnt pickup openspec's agents.md ",

I love Dex's work!\n\nYeah this is something I've considered, but initially decided against because I wanted to keep the overall amount of steps minimal to limit complexity. \n\nIf we do include a research phase I think it would be an optional command you can run. I think the question though I would have is do we really need to create a seperate `research.md` file or similar.\n\nI think this definitely makes a difference for larger codebases and changes that touch multiple filepaths etc where more search is needed. \n\nA question I have though is have you felt a difference in practice or does this sound nice in theory. What problems have your run into personally without this feature? \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm open to this and happy to add things in but a little reluctant to add in things that increase complexity but only provide a minimal benefit. \n\nI'll experiment with this either ways, but let me know your thoughts so I can add it to the roadmap!",

          "body": "@sebastianjung Thats sort of what I had before, as much as I would like that, I think the issue is most agents are not able to really follow that kind of instruction reliably to be honest.\n\nIn my experience most of the time they will either forget or just not do it at all. The current instructions are optimized for agents that have todo or task list functionality, this makes it easy for them to add a task to mark off work done at the end.\n\nThey usually limit themselves on the number of items on their todo list so having a task to tick something off after each step probably isn't ideal.\n\nThat being said, the instructions are editable! Try updating the instructions to something you like locally and let me know if you can get it to work reliably!! - If so I'm happy to re-cosider and update this.\n\nAlternatively others have requested a seperate `/verify` command that checks what tasks have been completed and ticks them off. So it's something you can run after doing `/apply`. Let me know what you think of this approach?\n\n",

This project is an example of such a process: https://github.com/rizethereum/claude-code-requirements-builder\n\nIt would be a killer feature in your project to have something like \u201cproposal-interactive\u201d that triggers the same kind of workflow.

I'm keen to try something like this out!\n\nLike I said in the discord we do want to give people the option to choose between the 2 types of workflows, so maybe a seperate slash command here would work best.\n\n I'd be keen to learn more about about the type of questions you'd like to ask. What do you mainly care about here? Is it the scope of the requirements? Getting the requirements right? Keeping them minimal? \n\nWould love to know what questions you've found useful so far - ones that have made you go \"I'm so glad it asked me that\". Or ones you really wished it asked you.\n\nIf you guys could reach out to me through any of these channels, I'd appreciate it, so I can build this out in a way that makes sense!\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/Narrow-Breakfast126/\nX: https://x.com/0xTab\nDiscord: tab_dev",

So it wasn't necessarily the scope of requirements, nor keeping it minimal, but it was good at finding necessary context before implementation.\n\nI've had fond memories with it because i was testing before doing several feature/bug fixing with and without that framework,  around 70% of the time i had better output when it's used. The 30% it did not, doesn't necessarily mean it had produced bad output, just wasted time reading/answering questions with little to no noticeable better output.\n\n> Would love to know what questions you've found useful so far\n\nI cannot recall really since it was ~4 months ago i last used CC (i mean i can use it anywhere now since it's just a slash command, only CC had slash commands before - but i prefer optimizing my workflow one at time now which is openspec). However, just in a hindsight memory i think questions like these ones that i made up:\n\n- \"We already have this feature X that has Y function which is a similar pattern, should we follow Y function?\"\n- \"Will user need to this X stuff?\" \n- \"Just a recommendation, should we also implement X feature?\"\n- \"Would you like if we add this error fallback?\"\n- \"There's a possibility of having this edge case issue, should we mitigate it by this proposed X function?\"\netc...\n\nOut of 10 questions it asks, maybe only half of it was good and not just common sense or obvious answers, and a fraction is **\"I'm so glad it asked me that\"** moments which is already sufficient to steer the AI agent with better guidance than without it. \nSometimes i was even able to improve the idea of the feature as i kept answering questions due to moments \"oh you're right, you got a point, i missed that\".\n\n\nI totally agree exposing this as an optional command since not all have time to read and answer discovery questions.\n\nI am open to ideas too while still thinking on how can we improved upon that idea without going overboard.  \n\nI'll share once i got new ideas.",

Out of curiosity, did it fail once or does it just not work at all no matter what you try?",

Thus the chat session not using openspec instructions.\n\n<img width=\"637\" height=\"1172\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa90088-61a6-4dd0-8ec0-c93eeb8e0372\" />\n\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"1312\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c93f76b-2e34-413c-8b99-02b629e9fb20\" />",
