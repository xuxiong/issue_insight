      "title": "[Droid CLI] Misses BMAD v6 agents/commands when nested under subdirectories",
      "body": "### \ud83e\udde9 Summary\n`droid` only discovers **direct children** of `.factory/droids` and `.factory/commands`.  \nNested files are ignored, breaking discovery for **BMAD v6**, where agents and workflows are stored under nested folders like `.claude/commands/bmad/**`.\n\nThis behavior prevents Droid from detecting valid BMAD content unless flattened manually.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Environment\n\n| Component | Version / Path |\n|------------|----------------|\n| **Repo** | `bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD` (`v6-alpha`) |\n| **BMAD v6 content** | `.claude/commands/bmad/**` (agents + workflows) |\n| **Droid CLI expects** | `.factory/droids/*.md`, `.factory/commands/*.md` |\n| **Observed visible file** | `.factory/droids/a.md:1` |\n| **Droid CLI** | `v0.21.5` |\n| **Node.js** | `v22.16.0` |\n| **OS** | Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL) |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Reproduction\n\n1. Create nested BMAD content:\n   - `.factory/droids/bmb/agents/bmad-builder.md:1`\n   - `.factory/commands/bmb/workflows/redoc.md:1`\n2. Start Droid CLI and list agents/commands.\n\n**Actual:** Neither appears.\n\n3. Move the files to top-level:\n   - `.factory/droids/bmb__agents__bmad-builder.md`\n   - `.factory/commands/bmb__workflows__redoc.md`\n4. Restart Droid.\n\n**Expected:** Both now appear.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Expected vs \u274c Actual\n\n| | Expected | Actual |\n|---|-----------|--------|\n| **Discovery** | Recursively finds `**/*.{md,mdux}` under `.factory/droids` and `.factory/commands`. | Only direct children are discovered. |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 Impact\n- BMAD v6 users **cannot organize** agents or commands by namespace.\n- Integration friction between BMAD v6 and Droid CLI.\n- Risk of **dual source-of-truth** between `.claude/**` (authored) and `.factory/**` (consumed).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Additional Observations\n- Agents work when flattened and contain valid front matter.\n- Many BMAD workflows lack front matter, causing discovery or later execution failures.\n- Some agent menus reference `workflow.yaml` files not present in Markdown-only repos.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Proposed Solutions\n\n#### **Preferred (Code Fix)**\nEnable recursive discovery for:\n- `.factory/droids/**/*.{md,mdux}`\n- `.factory/commands/**/*.{md,mdux}`\n\n#### **Alternative (Docs Update)**\nDocument current shallow-scan behavior and recommend flattening via a helper script.  \nDefine filename convention for namespaces: replace `/` with `__`.\n\nFront matter requirements:\n- **Agents**\n  - name\n  - description\n  - model: inherit *(optional)*\n- **Commands**\n  - name\n  - description\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Suggested BMAD Docs Additions\n- Document current Droid CLI behavior:\n  - `.factory/droids/*.md`\n  - `.factory/commands/*.md`\n  - *(Direct children only if no recursion)*\n- Include flattening script example and minimal front-matter template.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Workaround (Flattening Script)\n\n    node - <<'NODE'\n    const fs = require('fs'), p = require('path');\n    const base = p.join(process.cwd(), '.claude', 'commands', 'bmad');\n    function* files(dir){for(const e of fs.readdirSync(dir)){const f=p.join(dir,e),s=fs.statSync(f);if(s.isDirectory())yield*files(f);else if(/\\\\.(md|mdux)$/i.test(e))yield f;}}\n    function ensure(d){fs.mkdirSync(d,{recursive:true});}\n    function flat(r){return r.replace(/[\\\\\\\\/]/g,'__');}\n    for(const f of files(base)){\n      const rel=p.relative(base,f);\n      if(/[/\\\\\\\\]agents[/\\\\\\\\]/.test(rel)){\n        const out=p.join('.factory','droids',flat(rel));ensure(p.dirname(out));fs.copyFileSync(f,out);\n      }else if(/[/\\\\\\\\]workflows[/\\\\\\\\]/.test(rel)){\n        const out=p.join('.factory','commands',flat(rel));ensure(p.dirname(out));fs.copyFileSync(f,out);\n      }\n    }\n    console.log('Flattened agents to .factory/droids/* and commands to .factory/commands/*');\n    NODE\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Requested Changes\n1. **Droid CLI:** Add recursive discovery for `.factory/droids` and `.factory/commands`.\n2. **Docs (BMAD v6):** Add \u201cDroid CLI integration\u201d section with flattening and front-matter details.\n3. *(Optional)* Clarify `workflow.yaml` handling and fallback behavior.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Classification\nThis is best categorized as a **bug**, not a new feature.  \nReason: Current behavior breaks valid nested agent/command structures that BMAD v6 legitimately produces.  \nRecursive discovery is standard expected CLI behavior.",

      "title": "[Compatibility] Claude Code does not discover slash commands in nested directories under .claude/commands/bmad/",
      "body": "## Bug Description\n\n  After installing BMad Method v6-alpha with Claude Code selected as the IDE, the BMad agent slash commands do not     \n  appear in Claude Code's autocomplete or command menu. The installer creates the proper directory structure at        \n  `.claude/commands/bmad/` with all agent and workflow files correctly formatted, but Claude Code only discovers       \n  commands at the root level of `.claude/commands/`, not in nested subdirectories.\n\n  ## Environment\n\n  - **OS**: Windows 11 (MINGW64_NT-10.0-19045)\n  - **Node.js**: v20+\n  - **BMad Version**: v6-alpha\n  - **Branch**: v6-alpha\n  - **IDE**: Claude Code (latest version)\n  - **Modules Installed**: BMM, BMB, CIS\n\n  ## Steps to Reproduce\n\n  1. Clone BMAD-METHOD repository and checkout v6-alpha branch\n  2. Run `npm install` in the BMAD-METHOD directory\n  3. Run `npm run install:bmad` and complete the interactive installer:\n     - Select Claude Code as the IDE\n     - Select desired modules (BMM, BMB, CIS, etc.)\n     - Complete configuration prompts\n  4. Verify installation creates `.claude/commands/bmad/` directory structure with subdirectories:\n     - `.claude/commands/bmad/bmm/agents/*.md`\n     - `.claude/commands/bmad/bmm/workflows/*.md`\n     - `.claude/commands/bmad/core/agents/*.md`\n     - etc.\n  5. Restart Claude Code\n  6. Type `/` to view available slash commands\n  7. Observe that BMad commands do not appear in the autocomplete list\n\n  ## Expected Behavior\n\n  BMad agent commands should be discoverable and executable via slash commands such as:\n  - `/bmad:bmm:agents:dev` (or similar pattern based on directory structure)\n  - `/bmad:bmm:agents:sm`\n  - `/bmad:core:agents:bmad-master`\n  - All installed workflow commands\n\n  ## Actual Behavior\n\n  Claude Code's slash command system does **not** discover or register commands stored in nested directories under     \n  `.claude/commands/`. Only commands at the root level (e.g., `.claude/commands/test-command.md`) appear in\n  autocomplete and are executable.\n\n  ## Verification Testing\n\n  Created a test command at `.claude/commands/test-bmad.md` (root level) with proper frontmatter:\n  ```markdown\n  ---\n  name: \"test-bmad\"\n  description: \"Test command to verify Claude Code slash commands work\"\n  ---\n  ```\n\n  Result: After restarting Claude Code, /test-bmad appears and works correctly, confirming that Claude Code's\n  command discovery system functions but only scans the root .claude/commands/ directory, not nested\n  subdirectories.\n\n  ## Current Workaround\n\n  Created flattened alias commands at the root level that reference the nested BMad agents:\n\n  Example (.claude/commands/bmad-dev.md):\n  ```markdown\n  ---\n  name: \"bmad-dev\"\n  description: \"Activate BMad Developer Agent (Amelia) for story implementation\"\n  ---\n \n  Activate this agent: '.claude/commands/bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md'\n  \n  ```\n\n  This workaround successfully makes BMad agents accessible via /bmad-dev, /bmad-sm, etc., but requires manual\n  creation of root-level wrapper files.\n\n  ## Impact\n\n  - Users installing BMad v6-alpha with Claude Code cannot use BMad agents via slash commands without manual\n  workarounds\n  - The installer's designed directory structure (clean organization under bmad/ subdirectory) is incompatible with    \n   Claude Code's command discovery mechanism\n  - Documentation in bmad/docs/claude-code-instructions.md suggests commands like /bmad:bmm:agents:dev should work,    \n   but they don't\n\n  ## Suggested Solutions\n\n  1. Short-term: Document this Claude Code limitation in the v6-alpha README and installation guide\n  2. Medium-term: Update the Claude Code installer to automatically create flattened alias commands at\n  .claude/commands/ root level (e.g., bmad-dev.md, bmad-sm.md) that reference the nested agent files\n  3. Long-term: Coordinate with Anthropic's Claude Code team to request support for nested directory scanning in       \n  slash command discovery\n\n  ## Additional Context\n\n  - This appears to be a Claude Code limitation rather than a BMad bug, but it affects BMad's usability\n  - Similar issues reported in Claude Code repo: anthropics/claude-code#2288, #1212, #8831, #697\n  - BMad installation otherwise works correctly - all files are properly formatted with correct frontmatter (name,     \n  description fields)\n  - The bmad/ directory structure is well-organized and the nested approach makes sense for a large framework; the     \n  limitation is purely on Claude Code's side\n\n  ## Related Files\n\n  - .claude/commands/bmad/ - Complete nested directory structure (73+ command files)\n  - bmad/docs/claude-code-instructions.md - Current documentation assuming nested commands work\n  - bmad/bmm/sub-modules/claude-code/readme.md - Claude Code sub-module documentation\n",

      "title": "PRD workflow doesn't route to UX-Spec for UI-heavy projects",
      "body": "# v6-alpha PRD workflow doesn't route to UX-Spec for UI-heavy projects\n\n\n## Describe the bug\n\nThe PRD workflow (`bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/`) includes Step 5 which captures high-level UX/UI vision and explicitly states: \"Detailed UX planning happens in the UX workflow after PRD completion.\"\n\nHowever, Step 10 (workflow completion) routes Level 2 projects to `tech-spec` and Level 3+ projects to `solution-architecture`, but **never routes to the UX-Spec workflow**, even for projects with significant UI components.\n\nThis creates a gap where UI-heavy projects skip detailed UX design despite the PRD workflow acknowledging it should happen.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install BMAD V6-alpha\n2. Run `workflow-init` for a new Level 3+ project with UI components\n3. Complete Product Brief workflow\n4. Run PRD workflow (`/bmad:bmm:workflows:prd`)\n5. Complete Step 5 (UX/UI Vision) - note the message about \"detailed UX planning happens in the UX workflow after PRD completion\"\n6. Complete remaining PRD steps through Step 10\n7. Observe the completion routing\n\n**Result:** Workflow routes directly to `solution-architecture` without prompting for UX-Spec\n\n**Observed in workflow status file:**\n```markdown\n#### UX-Spec (PM)\n**Status:** Planned\n**Goal:** Design dashboards, workbenches, analyst interfaces\n**Note:** Required because project has UI components\n```\nStatus file recognizes UX-Spec as needed, but PRD automation doesn't route to it.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nWhen completing the PRD workflow for a project with significant UI components:\n\n1. Step 10 should detect UI complexity (either through project metadata or user confirmation)\n2. Prompt user: \"This project has significant UI components. Create detailed UX specification before architecture? (recommended)\"\n3. If yes \u2192 route to `ux-spec` workflow\n4. If no \u2192 route to existing logic (`solution-architecture` for Level 3+, `tech-spec` for Level 2)\n\nFor backend-heavy or minimal UI projects, skip directly to existing routing.\n\n## Please be Specific if relevant\n\n**Model(s) Used:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)\n**Agentic IDE Used:** Claude Code CLI\n**WebSite Used:** N/A (local BMAD installation)\n**Project Language:** N/A (workflow framework issue)\n**BMad Method version:** V6-alpha (6.0.0-alpha.0)\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- `bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/instructions.md` (Step 10, lines 408-451)\n\n**Related Workflows:**\n- `bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/ux/` (exists but not auto-routed)\n- `bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/` (status tracking)\n\n## Screenshots or Links\n\nN/A - This is a workflow routing logic issue in the instructions file.\n\n## Additional context\n\n### Current Code (Step 10, lines 431-443):\n```markdown\n{{#if project_level == 2}}\n- Review PRD and epics with stakeholders\n- **Next:** Run `tech-spec` for lightweight technical planning\n- Then proceed to implementation\n{{/if}}\n\n{{#if project_level >= 3}}\n- Review PRD and epics with stakeholders\n- **Next:** Run `solution-architecture` for full technical design\n- Then proceed to implementation\n{{/if}}\n```\n\n### Suggested Addition (Before existing routing):\n\n```xml\n<check if=\"has significant UI components\">\n  <ask>This project includes significant UI components. Would you like to:\n\n1. Create detailed UX specification (recommended for complex UIs)\n2. Skip UX-Spec and proceed to {{next_workflow}} (architecture or tech-spec)\n  </ask>\n\n  <check if=\"option 1 - create UX spec\">\n    <invoke-workflow path=\"{project-root}/bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status\">\n      <param>mode: update</param>\n      <param>action: set_current_workflow</param>\n      <param>workflow_name: ux-spec</param>\n    </invoke-workflow>\n\n    <output>**Next:** Run `ux-spec` for detailed UX/UI design\n\nAfter UX-Spec, proceed to:\n{{#if project_level == 2}}tech-spec{{/if}}\n{{#if project_level >= 3}}solution-architecture{{/if}}\n    </output>\n\n    <action>Exit workflow - route to ux-spec</action>\n  </check>\n\n  <check if=\"option 2 - skip UX spec\">\n    <action>Continue to existing routing logic</action>\n  </check>\n</check>\n```\n\n### UI Detection Heuristics (Suggestions):\n\n**Simple approach:**\n- Check if Step 5 (UX/UI Vision) was completed (not skipped)\n- Search `functional_requirements` for UI keywords: \"dashboard\", \"visualization\", \"interactive\", \"workbench\", \"interface\", \"UI\", \"frontend\"\n\n**Metadata approach:**\n- Add `has_complex_ui: true/false` to project config\n- Set during `workflow-init` or `product-brief`\n- Use in PRD routing decision\n\n**Always ask approach:**\n- For Level 2+ projects, always ask after Step 5 completes\n- Let user decide based on UI complexity\n\n### Real-World Impact:\n\nDiscovered during a Level 3-4 project with complex UI components:\n- Interactive data visualizations (mesh/graph rendering with zoom/pan)\n- Real-time data streaming interfaces\n- Multiple view modes and layout options\n- Complex user interaction patterns\n\n**What happened:**\n1. PRD workflow captured high-level UX principles (DONE)\n2. PRD mentioned \"detailed UX planning happens in the UX workflow after PRD completion\" (DONE)\n3. PRD completed and routed to `solution-architecture` (BUG - should offer UX-Spec first)\n4. UX-Spec was never triggered (BUG)\n5. Proceeded to epic breakdown without detailed wireframes/interaction design\n\n### Workaround (Current):\n\nUsers must manually:\n1. Notice UX-Spec was skipped\n2. Check workflow status to find UX-Spec in planned workflows\n3. Manually invoke UX-Spec workflow before continuing\n\n---\n\n**Reported by:** @steveant (or @santonakakis)\n\nThank you for maintaining BMAD! This framework has been incredibly helpful for structured project planning. The V6-alpha improvements are excellent. \n",

      "title": "feat: OCR-based data extraction and Excel consolidation workflow",
      "body": "## Overview\n\nAdd a new BMM workflow for automated OCR-based data extraction and Excel consolidation. This workflow will process large volumes of documents (PDFs, Excel files, Outlook messages) using Mistral OCR via OpenRouter API, extract structured data, and consolidate it into a master Excel file - demonstrating BMAD-METHOD's capability for document processing and data automation tasks.\n\n## Problem Statement / Motivation\n\n**Current Challenge:**\nOrganizations often receive hundreds of sales reports, invoices, or forms in various formats (PDF, Excel, email attachments) that need manual data entry into a master spreadsheet. This is:\n- Time-consuming and error-prone\n- Difficult to scale (200+ files/month in real-world scenario)\n- Requires repetitive manual work that AI could handle\n\n**Use Case:**\nDaily sales reports from multiple tenants arrive in mixed formats throughout the year, organized in folders by month and year. Currently, these require manual review and data entry into a master tracking spreadsheet.\n\n**Why BMAD-METHOD:**\nThis represents an ideal use case for BMAD's agent orchestration capabilities:\n- Structured workflow with clear phases\n- Requires AI integration (OCR + data extraction)\n- Benefits from human oversight and validation\n- Demonstrates bidirectional AI-human guidance\n- Natural language configuration for non-technical users\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a new **document processing workflow** in the BMM module that orchestrates:\n\n1. **Document Discovery:** Scan nested folder structures for unprocessed files\n2. **OCR Processing:** Send documents to Mistral OCR API via OpenRouter\n3. **Data Extraction:** Parse OCR results into structured format using LLM\n4. **Data Validation:** Present extracted data for human review/correction\n5. **Excel Integration:** Append validated data to master spreadsheet\n6. **File Management:** Move processed files to \"done\" folder with audit trail\n\n**Example Folder Structure:**\n\\`\\`\\`\n/project-root/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 source-documents/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 2020/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 00 Year 2020 (late submit)/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 2021/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 01. Jan 2021/ (207 files)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02. Feb 2021/ (217 files)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 2022/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 processed/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 done/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 master-file.xlsx\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n\n**New Components:**\n\n1. **Agent: \\`data-extraction-agent.agent.yaml\\`**\n   - Persona: Data extraction specialist\n   - Capabilities: OCR interpretation, data parsing, validation\n   - Menu commands: \\`/extract-batch\\`, \\`/validate-data\\`, \\`/export-to-excel\\`\n\n2. **Workflow: \\`bmm/workflows/data-extraction/ocr-to-excel/\\`**\n   - Configuration: API keys, folder paths, field mappings\n   - Template: Excel mapping configuration\n   - Instructions: Step-by-step extraction process\n   - Checklist: Validation criteria\n\n3. **Reusable Tasks:**\n   - \\`task-ocr-process.js\\`: Send file to Mistral OCR API\n   - \\`task-data-parser.js\\`: Parse OCR results into structured JSON\n   - \\`task-excel-writer.js\\`: Append data to master Excel file\n   - \\`task-file-mover.js\\`: Move processed files with logging\n\n4. **Configuration File: \\`ocr-extraction-config.yaml\\`**\n   \\`\\`\\`yaml\n   api:\n     provider: openrouter\n     model: mistral-ocr\n     api_key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}\n   \n   paths:\n     source_folder: \"./source-documents\"\n     processed_folder: \"./processed/done\"\n     master_file: \"./master-file.xlsx\"\n   \n   extraction_fields:\n     - store_name\n     - date\n     - sales_amount\n     - part_timer_name\n     - shift_hours\n   \n   file_types:\n     - pdf\n     - xlsx\n     - xls\n     - msg\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- **xlsx** (npm): Excel file reading/writing\n- **pdf-parse** or similar: PDF text extraction fallback\n- **node-fetch**: API calls to OpenRouter\n- **fs-extra**: File operations (already in project)\n- **glob**: File discovery (already in project)\n\n**API Integration:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\n// Example OCR call structure (user has working samples)\nconst response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Authorization': \\`Bearer \\${apiKey}\\`,\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    model: 'mistral/pixtral-large-latest',\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: 'user',\n        content: [\n          { type: 'image_url', image_url: { url: base64Image } },\n          { type: 'text', text: 'Extract sales data: store name, date, amount...' }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  })\n});\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Workflow Phases\n\n**Phase 1: Discovery & Scanning**\n- Recursively scan source folders\n- Filter by file type and processed status\n- Generate processing queue with metadata\n\n**Phase 2: OCR & Extraction**\n- For each file in queue:\n  - Convert to image/extract pages if needed\n  - Send to Mistral OCR API\n  - Retry logic for API failures\n  - Log extraction results\n\n**Phase 3: Parsing & Validation**\n- Parse OCR text into structured data\n- Apply field mapping from config\n- Present to user for validation via CLI prompts\n- Allow corrections/overrides\n\n**Phase 4: Excel Integration**\n- Load master Excel file\n- Append new row with extracted data\n- Add metadata (source file, processing date, confidence score)\n- Save with backup\n\n**Phase 5: Cleanup**\n- Move processed file to done folder\n- Maintain original folder structure in done folder\n- Log summary statistics\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **Workflow Installation:** User can install workflow via \\`bmad install workflow ocr-to-excel\\`\n- [ ] **Configuration Setup:** Wizard prompts for API key, folder paths, field mappings\n- [ ] **File Discovery:** Correctly identifies all files in nested year/month folder structure\n- [ ] **Multi-Format Support:** Processes PDF, XLSX, XLS, and MSG file types\n- [ ] **OCR Integration:** Successfully calls Mistral OCR API via OpenRouter with proper error handling\n- [ ] **Data Extraction:** Parses OCR results and extracts configured fields into structured JSON\n- [ ] **Human Validation:** Presents extracted data for review with ability to edit before saving\n- [ ] **Excel Writing:** Appends validated data to master Excel file without corrupting existing data\n- [ ] **File Management:** Moves processed files to done folder maintaining folder structure\n- [ ] **Batch Processing:** Processes multiple files with progress tracking and pause/resume capability\n- [ ] **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles API failures, invalid files, and parsing errors with retry logic\n- [ ] **Audit Trail:** Logs all operations with timestamps, success/failure status, and error details\n\n### Quality Requirements\n\n- [ ] **Test Coverage:** Unit tests for OCR, parsing, and Excel writing tasks (>80% coverage)\n- [ ] **Integration Tests:** End-to-end test with sample files and mock API responses\n- [ ] **Documentation:** Comprehensive README with setup instructions and field mapping examples\n- [ ] **Error Messages:** Clear, actionable error messages following BMAD conventions\n- [ ] **Performance:** Process 100 files in <30 minutes (excluding API wait time)\n- [ ] **Validation:** Code passes \\`npm run validate\\`, \\`npm run lint\\`, \\`npm run format:check\\`\n\n### User Experience\n\n- [ ] **Setup Time:** First-time setup takes <5 minutes with guided prompts\n- [ ] **Natural Language Config:** All configuration in YAML with inline comments\n- [ ] **Progress Visibility:** Real-time progress bar showing files processed/remaining\n- [ ] **Interruption Recovery:** Can safely stop and resume processing without losing progress\n- [ ] **Confidence Scores:** Display OCR confidence for each extraction, flag low-confidence items\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Efficiency Gains:**\n- **Time Savings:** Reduce 200 files/month from ~40 hours manual work to <2 hours AI + human validation\n- **Accuracy:** Achieve >95% field extraction accuracy on first pass\n- **Throughput:** Process 10-15 files per minute (API rate limit dependent)\n\n**Framework Value:**\n- **Reusability:** Workflow configuration reusable for other document types (invoices, forms, receipts)\n- **Example Impact:** Serves as compelling use case for BMAD-METHOD v6 alpha\n- **Community Engagement:** Generates interest from accounting/finance automation community\n\n**Technical Metrics:**\n- **API Success Rate:** >98% successful OCR API calls with retry logic\n- **Data Integrity:** 0 corrupted Excel files or data loss incidents\n- **Error Recovery:** 100% of failures logged with actionable troubleshooting info\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Scale & Performance\n\n**Current Scope:**\n- ~2,400 files/year (200/month average across 12 months)\n- Mixed file sizes (PDFs: 50KB-2MB, Excel: 10KB-500KB)\n- API rate limits: OpenRouter Mistral OCR (check current limits)\n\n**Optimizations:**\n- **Parallel Processing:** Process N files concurrently (configurable, default 3)\n- **Caching:** Cache OCR results to avoid reprocessing on validation changes\n- **Incremental Processing:** Track processed files to avoid reprocessing entire folders\n- **Smart Queuing:** Prioritize smaller files first for faster user feedback\n\n### Security & Privacy\n\n- [ ] **API Key Management:** Store in environment variables, never commit to git\n- [ ] **Data Privacy:** Warn users about sending potentially sensitive documents to external API\n- [ ] **Local Fallback:** Consider local OCR option (Tesseract) for sensitive documents\n- [ ] **Audit Logging:** Log file names but not document contents\n- [ ] **Backup Strategy:** Automatic backup of master Excel before each write operation\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Common Failure Modes:**\n1. **API Failures:** Timeout, rate limit, authentication error\n   - Solution: Exponential backoff retry, queue failed items for manual retry\n2. **Invalid File Format:** Corrupted PDF, password-protected document\n   - Solution: Skip with warning, log for manual review\n3. **Parsing Errors:** OCR returns unexpected format\n   - Solution: Prompt user with raw OCR text for manual extraction\n4. **Excel Corruption:** Write operation fails mid-process\n   - Solution: Restore from automatic backup, atomic write operations\n5. **Disk Space:** Running out of storage during large batch\n   - Solution: Check available space before starting, warn at 90% capacity\n\n### Extensibility\n\n**Future Enhancements:**\n- [ ] Support for additional OCR providers (Google Vision, AWS Textract)\n- [ ] Custom field mapping UI (web-based configuration)\n- [ ] Database output option (PostgreSQL, SQLite) in addition to Excel\n- [ ] Scheduled batch processing (cron-style automation)\n- [ ] Multi-language support for OCR extraction\n- [ ] Advanced validation rules (regex patterns, range checks)\n- [ ] Integration with cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)\n\n## Dependencies & Risks\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**Required Before Implementation:**\n- [ ] OpenRouter API account and credits (user already has this)\n- [ ] Excel file structure analysis tool (to map fields correctly)\n- [ ] Sample working code provided by user (for OCR API integration)\n\n**Nice to Have:**\n- [ ] Test dataset with known-good extractions for validation\n- [ ] Design mockups for validation UI (CLI-based)\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|------------|------------|\n| API rate limiting causes slow processing | High | Medium | Implement configurable delays, queue management, parallel limit controls |\n| OCR accuracy insufficient for certain file types | High | Medium | Allow manual extraction fallback, build confidence scoring, suggest file quality improvements |\n| Excel file corruption during write | Critical | Low | Atomic writes with rollback, automatic backups before each write |\n| MSG file format parsing complexity | Medium | High | Use existing libraries (msg-reader), provide clear error if unsupported |\n| Large batch processing memory issues | Medium | Low | Stream processing, memory profiling, garbage collection optimization |\n\n### Project Risks\n\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Scope creep - users request many custom field types | Medium | High | Clear v1 scope, design for extensibility via config, defer custom logic to v2 |\n| OpenRouter pricing changes affect user costs | Medium | Medium | Document cost estimates, allow custom API endpoint override |\n| v6 alpha API changes break integration | High | Low | Follow BMAD-METHOD v6 conventions closely, engage with maintainers |\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n###

      "title": "Feature Request: Technical Research Sub-Agents for Architecture & Technology Evaluation",
      "body": "**Did you discuss the idea first in Discord Server (#general-dev)?**\n\n[ ] Yes - Link: _[To be filled]_\n[X] No - Submitting for initial review\n\n---\n\n## Problem Description\n\n### Current State\n\nThe BMM research workflow (`bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/`) currently includes 5 specialized sub-agents optimized for **market research**:\n\n- `bmm-market-researcher` - Market intelligence and TAM/SAM/SOM analysis\n- `bmm-data-analyst` - Quantitative market analysis and business metrics\n- `bmm-trend-spotter` - Market trends and disruption forecasting\n- `bmm-competitor-analyzer` - Competitive positioning analysis\n- `bmm-user-researcher` - User personas and journey mapping\n\n### The Gap\n\nWhen executing **Technical/Architecture Research** workflows (Option 3 in the research router), there are **NO specialized sub-agents** to assist with:\n\n- Technology stack evaluation and comparison\n- Architecture pattern analysis and validation\n- Framework maturity assessment and production readiness evaluation\n- Integration pattern research and API evaluation\n- Infrastructure design decisions\n- Performance and scalability analysis\n\n**Impact:** Technical research queries must be executed sequentially by the main Analyst agent without specialized assistance, resulting in:\n- Slower execution (no parallelization opportunities)\n- Less specialized analysis depth for technical decisions\n- Inconsistent evaluation frameworks across technology assessments\n- Missed opportunities to apply domain-specific research methodologies\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a **Technical Research Sub-Agent Suite** mirroring the market research sub-agent architecture, with 3 specialized agents:\n\n### 1. `bmm-technical-evaluator.md`\n**Expertise:** Framework and technology stack evaluation\n- Production readiness assessment (maturity, community, adoption)\n- Feature parity analysis and capability comparison\n- Deployment complexity evaluation\n- Learning curve and documentation quality assessment\n- Enterprise suitability criteria\n\n### 2. `bmm-architecture-analyst.md`\n**Expertise:** Architecture pattern analysis and system design\n- Pattern identification and validation (microservices, event-driven, CQRS, etc.)\n- Scalability and performance architecture\n- Multi-tenancy patterns and isolation strategies\n- Cloud-native architecture patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP)\n- Integration architecture and API gateway patterns\n\n### 3. `bmm-integration-specialist.md`\n**Expertise:** Integration patterns and API research\n- API integration patterns and best practices\n- Authentication and authorization patterns (OAuth, JWT, SAML)\n- Data synchronization strategies (real-time, batch, event-driven)\n- Middleware and gateway evaluation\n- Protocol analysis (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, MCP)\n\n### Configuration Enhancement\n\nAdd technical research sub-agent injection points to `instructions-technical.md`:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- IDE-INJECT-POINT: technical-research-subagents -->\n\n<invoke-subagent name=\"bmm-technical-evaluator\">\nEvaluate framework options against enterprise production criteria\n</invoke-subagent>\n\n<invoke-subagent name=\"bmm-architecture-analyst\">\nAnalyze architecture patterns and validate technical

Bedrock AgentCore for agent orchestration\n- 20-50 product codebases in multi-tenant vector database\n- Real-time diagnostics and log file analysis\n- Integration with Salesforce, Azure DevOps, JIRA, GitHub\n\n### Research Requirements (8 Critical Technical Decisions)\n\n1. **Agentic Framework:** Argo (AI3lab) vs Microsoft Semantic Kernel production readiness\n2. **Vector Database:** Aurora pgvector vs Amazon OpenSearch for multi-tenant knowledge\n3. **RAG Framework:** LangChain vs LlamaIndex vs Haystack for large log files\n4. **Dashboard Integration:** Apache Superset + Salesforce real-time analytics\n5. **LLM Providers:** Bedrock (Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5) vs Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro) vs OpenAI (GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex)\n\n### Value Add with Technical Sub-Agents\n\n#### Without Technical Sub-Agents (Current State):\n```\nSequential Execution by Single Analyst Agent:\n\u251c\u2500 Query 1: Framework evaluation (15 min)\n\u251c\u2500 Query 2: Vector DB comparison (15 min)\n\u251c\u2500 Query 3: RAG framework evaluation (15 min)\n\u251c\u2500 Query 4: Integration patterns (10 min)\n\u251c\u2500 Query 5: LLM provider comparison (15 min)\n\u2514\u2500 TOTAL: ~70 minutes sequential execution\n```\n\n**Limitations:**\n- A significant amount of high time-cost compactions triggered\n- Single agent lacks specialized evaluation frameworks\n- No parallel execution across different technical domains\n- Inconsistent depth across different technology categories\n\n#### With Technical Sub-Agents (Proposed):\n```\nParallel Execution with Specialized Sub-Agents:\n\n[Phase 1: Framework Layer] (Parallel - 15 min)\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-technical-evaluator: Argo vs Semantic Kernel maturity\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-architecture-analyst: AgentCore deployment patterns\n\u2514\u2500 bmm-integration-specialist: MCP Gateway integration\n\n[Phase 2: Data Layer] (Parallel - 15 min)\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-architecture-analyst: Vector DB multi-tenancy patterns\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-performance-analyzer: Query performance at scale\n\u2514\u2500 bmm-technical-evaluator: RAG framework capabilities\n\n[Phase 3: Integration Layer] (Parallel - 10 min)\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-integration-specialist: Superset + Salesforce patterns\n\u251c\u2500 bmm-infra-designer: Real-time data sync architecture\n\u2514\u2500 bmm-performance-analyzer: LLM latency comparison\n\nTOTAL: ~40 minutes parallel execution \n```\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n1. **Specialized Expertise Applied:**\n   - `bmm-technical-evaluator` applies production readiness frameworks (GitHub activity, documentation, enterprise adoption signals)\n   - `bmm-architecture-analyst` validates multi-tenancy isolation patterns\n   - `bmm-performance-analyzer` provides latency/throughput benchmarking methodologies\n   - `bmm-integration-specialist` evaluates API patterns and authentication strategies\n\n2. **Parallel Execution Across Domains:**\n   - Framework evaluation, architecture analysis, and integration research happen simultaneously\n   - Each sub-agent focuses on their domain while main agent orchestrates\n\n3. **Consistent Evaluation Frameworks:**\n   - Production readiness criteria applied uniformly across all frameworks\n   - Architecture pattern validation using standardized checklists\n   - Performance analysis using consistent benchmarking approaches\n\n4. **Deeper Technical Analysis:**\n   - Framework maturity: GitHub commits (last 3 months), community size, production deployments\n   - Architecture validation: Multi-tenancy isolation, scalability patterns, AWS integration\n   - Performance modeling: Latency P50/P95/P99, throughput at scale, cost optimization\n\n5. **Automated Quality Checks:**\n   - Sub-agents enforce technical evaluation completeness\n   - Ensure all critical criteria are addressed (security, scalability, observability)\n   - Validate assumptions with technical evidence\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n**Decision Quality Improvement:**\n- Framework choice backed by production readiness framework (not just feature lists)\n- Vector DB selection validated against multi-tenancy isolation patterns\n- RAG framework evaluated with chunking strategies for 100MB+ log files\n- Integration patterns validated against real-time streaming requirements\n- LLM providers compared with latency/accuracy trade-off analysis\n\n**Time Efficiency:**\n- Material time reduction through parallel execution\n- Reduced context switching for main Analyst agent\n- Specialized sub-agents maintain focus on domain expertise\n\n**Consistency:**\n- Standardized evaluation frameworks across all technology assessments\n- Reusable technical evaluation patterns for future projects\n- Quality gates enforced by specialized sub-agents\n\n---\n\n## Supporting

Update the existing `injections.yaml` entry with new SHA256 hash to reflect merged content\n- Update manifest hash after modifications\n\n### Design Principles\n\n1. **Mirror Market Research Architecture:** Follow proven sub-agent pattern from market research workflow\n2. **Domain-Specific Expertise:** Each sub-agent focuses on specific technical domain\n3. **Parallel Execution Ready:** Configuration enables concurrent sub-agent invocation\n4. **Framework Agnostic:** Sub-agents support any technical stack evaluation\n5. **Auto-Invoke When Relevant:** Intelligent triggering based on query context\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n- **Time Efficiency:** 30-50% reduction in technical research execution time\n- **Decision Quality:** Standardized evaluation frameworks applied consistently\n- **Reusability:** Sub-agents applicable across multiple technical research scenarios\n- **Completeness:** Technical evaluation criteria coverage increased\n\n### Related Workflows\n\nThis enhancement complements existing BMM workflows:\n- Phase 1 Analysis \u2192 Research (this enhancement)\n- Phase 2 Planning \u2192 PRD/Tech-Spec (benefits from research quality)\n- Phase 3 Solutioning \u2192 Architecture (benefits from validated patterns)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Real-World Use Case Origin\n\nThis feature request emerged from greenfield project preliminary research needs:\n- 8 technical research queries required for architecture decisions\n- Existing market research sub-agents not applicable to technical evaluation\n- Sequential execution limiting research efficiency\n- Need for specialized technical evaluation frameworks\n\n### Community Benefit\n\nTechnical research is common across BMM projects:\n- Framework selection (React vs Vue, FastAPI vs Django)\n- Database evaluation (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB, Aurora vs RDS)\n- Architecture patterns (monolith vs microservices, serverless vs containers)\n- Cloud provider selection (AWS vs Azure vs GCP services)\n\nTechnical sub-agents would benefit **all BMM users** conducting technology evaluation during Phase 1 Research.\n\n---\n\n",

      "body": "# GitHub Issue: BMAD v6 Alpha - Research Artifact Propagation Missing\n\n## Issue Title\n**[v6 Alpha] Solution Architecture workflow doesn't load Phase 1 research artifacts**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `solution-architecture` workflow in Phase 3 (Solutioning) only reads documents from Phase 2 (Planning) but **does not automatically load or reference research from Phase 1 (Analysis)**. This forces users to manually remember and reference research findings, defeating the purpose of a structured workflow system.\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Complete Phase 1 workflows (e.g., `research-deep`, `research-market`, `research-technical`)\n   - Generates research documents in `/research/`\n   - Generates technical specs and analysis documents with API inventories, cost constraints, technical requirements\n\n2. Complete Phase 2 workflows (`plan-project`, `ux-spec`, etc.)\n   - Generates PRD, UX spec, epics/stories\n   - These correctly reference each other\n\n3. Run Phase 3 workflow (`solution-architecture`)\n   - **Expected:** Workflow loads research from Phase 1 automatically\n   - **Actual:** Workflow only reads PRD, UX spec, epics (Phase 2 documents)\n   - **Result:** User must manually remember to reference Phase 1 research\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n**User Experience:**\n- High cognitive load (must remember all research documents)\n- Easy to miss critical findings (APIs, cost constraints, technical requirements)\n- Architecture may not align with research\n- No traceability from research \u2192 architecture decisions\n\n**Real Example:**\n- Phase 1: Research identified multiple API integrations and technical constraints\n- Phase 3: Initial architecture missed most of these details\n- **Why:** User had to manually remember to check the research documents\n- **Result:** Architecture had to be significantly revised after catching the missing requirements\n\n---\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nFrom `/BMAD-METHOD/src/modules/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/README.md`:\n\n```markdown\n### Step 1: Requirements Analysis\n\n**For Everything Else:**\n- Read **PRD** (Product Requirements Document)\n- Extract: FRs, NFRs, epics, stories, integrations\n\n**For UI Projects:**\n- Read **UX Specification**\n- Extract: screens, flows, component patterns\n```\n\n**What's Missing:**\n```markdown\n### Step 0.5: Research Context Loading (MISSING)\n\n- Read research artifacts from Phase 1\n- Load API inventories, cost constraints, technical analyses\n- Present findings to architect before starting\n```\n\n---\n\n## Current Schema Gap\n\nThe `bmm-workflow-status-template.md` includes an \"Artifacts Generated\" section (lines 156-163):\n\n```markdown\n### Artifacts Generated\n\n| Artifact | Status | Location | Date |\n| -------- | ------ | -------- | ---- |\n\n{{#artifacts}}\n| {{name}} | {{status}} | {{path}} | {{date}} |\n{{/artifacts}}\n```\n\n**Problem:** This section:\n- \u2705 Exists (good!)\n- \u274c Doesn't categorize artifacts by phase\n- \u274c Doesn't distinguish research (Phase 1) from planning (Phase 2)\n- \u274c Isn't surfaced to Phase 3 workflows automatically\n- \u274c Doesn't extract key findings from artifacts\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `solution-architecture` workflow should:\n\n1. **Auto-discover Phase 1 research** from `bmm-workflow-status.md` artifacts section\n2. **Load research artifacts** (APIs, costs, constraints, methodologies)\n3. **Present context** to user before generating architecture\n4. **Reference research** throughout architecture generation\n5. **Trace decisions** back to research findings\n\n**Proposed Flow:**\n```\nStep 0: Load bmm-workflow-status.md\n  \u2193\nStep 0.5: Load Phase 1 Artifacts (NEW)\n  - Read research documents listed in workflow status\n  - Extract: APIs, cost constraints, technical requirements\n  - Present summary to user\n  \u2193\nStep 1: Requirements Analysis (existing)\n  - Read PRD, UX spec (Phase 2)\n  \u2193\nStep 2+: Generate architecture using BOTH Phase 1 + Phase 2 context\n```\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Option A: Enhance bmm-workflow-status.md (Recommended)\n\n**Rationale:** Leverages existing tracking system\n\n**Change 1: Update workflow status schema**\n\nCurrently the template (`src/modules/bmm/workflows/_shared/bmm-workflow-status-template.md` lines 156-163) has:\n```markdown\n### Artifacts Generated\n\n| Artifact | Status | Location | Date |\n| -------- | ------ | -------- | ---- |\n\n{{#artifacts}}\n| {{name}} | {{status}} | {{path}} | {{date}} |\n{{/artifacts}}\n```\n\n**Proposed enhancement:**\n```markdown\n### Artifacts Generated\n\n#### Phase 1 - Analysis/Research\n| Artifact | Type | Location | Key Findings | Date |\n| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | ---- |\n| Research Report | Research | /research/report.md | Technical constraints identified | 2025-10-12 |\n| API Analysis | Technical | /docs/api-analysis.md | Integration requirements | 2025-10-13 |\n| Cost Analysis | Analysis | /docs/cost-analysis.md | Budget constraints | 2025-10-14 |\n\n**Key Constraints from Phase 1:**\n- Budget constraints\n- Technical requirements\n- API/Integration needs\n\n#### Phase 2 - Planning\n| Artifact | Type | Location | Date |\n| -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- |\n| Product Requirements | PRD | /docs/PRD.md | 2025-10-15 |\n| UX Specification | Design | /docs/ux-specification.md | 2025-10-15 |\n| Epics and Stories | Planning | /docs/epics.md | 2025-10-16 |\n\n#### Phase 3 - Solutioning\n(Artifacts appear here when Phase 3 completes)\n```\n\n**Change 2: Update solution-architecture workflow instructions**\n\nAdd new step after loading workflow status:\n```markdown\n### Step 0.5: Load Phase 1 Research Context\n\n1. Read `bmm-workflow-status.md`\n2. Check for Phase 1 artifacts section\n3. If artifacts exist:\n   a. Load each research document\n   b. Extract key findings (APIs, costs, constraints)\n   c. Present to user: \"Found X research documents with...\"\n   d. Ask: \"Incorporate these findings? (Y/n)\"\n4. If no artifacts:\n   a. Warn: \"No Phase 1 research found\"\n   b. Ask: \"Do you have research to reference?\"\n```\n\n**Change 3: Update architecture templates**\n\nAdd to all templates:\n```markdown\n## Document References\n\n**Planning Documents (Phase 2):**\n- PRD\n- UX Specification\n- Epics and Stories\n\n**Research Documents (Phase 1):**\n{{AUTO_POPULATED_FROM_WORKFLOW_STATUS}}\n\n**Key Research Findings Applied:**\n{{AUTO_POPULATED_KEY_FINDINGS}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option B: Research Manifest File\n\nCreate a separate `/docs/research-manifest.md` that tracks all Phase 1 outputs.\n\n**Pros:** Explicit, structured\n**Cons:** New file to maintain, another pattern to learn\n\n---\n\n### Option C: Auto-Discovery Pattern\n\nScan standard locations for research documents.\n\n**Pros:** No manual tracking\n**Cons:** Fragile, may miss documents in non-standard locations\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n**Use Option A (Enhance bmm-workflow-status.md)** because:\n- \u2705 Leverages existing workflow status tracking\n- \u2705 No new files or patterns to learn\n- \u2705 Natural workflow progression\n- \u2705 Minimal changes to existing system\n- \u2705 Easy to implement and maintain\n\n---\n\n## Related Workflows Affected\n\nThis issue likely affects other Phase 3+ workflows that should reference Phase 1 research:\n- `tech-spec` (Technical Specification)\n- `test-strategy` (Test Strategy)\n- `deployment-plan` (Deployment Planning)\n\nAll should have similar \"Research Context Loading\" steps.\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `/src/modules/bmm/workflows/_shared/bmm-workflow-status-template.md`\n   - Enhance Artifacts Generated section (lines 156-163)\n\n2. `/src/modules/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/instructions.md`\n   - Add Step 0.5 (Load Phase 1 artifacts)\n\n3. `/src/modules/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/templates/*.md`\n   - Add Document References section\n\n4. Phase 1 research workflows (future enhancement)\n   - Make them write artifacts to workflow status\n\n---\n\n## Testing the Fix\n\n**Before:**\n```bash\n$ workflow solution-architecture\n> Reading PRD...\n> Reading UX spec...\n> Generating architecture...\n# (No mention of Phase 1 research)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```bash\n$ workflow solution-architecture\n> Reading workflow status...\n> Found 3 research documents from Phase 1:\n>   - API Analysis: Integration requirements identified\n>   - Cost Analysis: Budget constraints documented\n>   - Technical Research: Architecture constraints\n> Incorporate these findings? (Y/n): y\n> Loading research context...\n> Reading PRD...\n> Reading UX spec...\n> Generating architecture (with research context)...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Priority\n\n**High** - This is a fundamental workflow design issue that affects all multi-phase projects.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Every user of BMAD v6 Alpha experiences this\n- Leads to incomplete/inconsistent architectures\n- High manual overhead (defeats workflow automation purpose)\n\n---\n\n## Workaround (Until Fixed)\n\n**Manual approach:**\n1. At start of solution-architecture workflow, manually reference research documents\n2. Add \"Document References\" section to architecture manually\n3. Create checklist of Phase 1 findings to incorporate\n\n**Better temporary fix:**\nAdd to project README:\n```markdown\n## Before Running Phase 3 Workflows\n\nReview these Phase 1 research documents:\n- [ ] /research/*.md\n- [ ] /docs/*-analysis.md\n- [ ] /docs/*-research.md\n\nKey findings to incorporate:\n- Technical requirements:\n- Cost constraints:\n- Integration needs:\n```\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\n**Discovery Process:**\n- User completed comprehensive Phase 1 research\n- Generated detailed technical analysis documents\n- Phase 3 architecture initially missed critical requirements\n- User had to manually catch missing details\n- This revealed the systemic gap in workflow artifact propagation\n\n**Root cause identified:**\nThe BMAD workflow system treats phases as independent silos instead of connected stages with artifact dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- [ ] Similar issue may exist for Phase 2 \u2192 Phase 4 propagation\n- [ ] Other Phase 3 workflows (tech-spec, test-strategy) likely have same issue\n- [ ] Need general pattern for cross-phase artifact loading\n\n---\n\n## Version Info\n\n- **BMAD Version:** v6 Alpha\n- **Workflow:** `solution-architecture`\n- **Project Type:** Web app\n- **Discovery Date:** 2025-10-17\n\n---\n\n_This issue was discovered during real-world usage and has been documented with a detailed improvement proposal._\n",

      "title": "Kilo Code Product Manager and Product Owner sharding issue with md-tree",
      "body": "The BMAD Method system has an inconsistency between agent modes and their available tools when performing document sharding operations. The Product Manager (bmad-pm) and Product Owner (bmad-po) modes have access to the *shard-prd and *shard-brief commands, which are designed to split large Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and briefs into smaller, more manageable sections. However, these modes lack access to the execute_command tool, which is required to run the md-tree command that performs the automatic sharding. This creates a disconnect where the commands are available but cannot be executed properly.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n1. Activate the Product Manager mode (bmad-pm) or Product Owner mode (bmad-po)\n2. Execute the *shard-prd command to shard a PRD document\n3. The system will attempt to use the md-tree command to automatically split the document\n4. The execution will fail because the execute_command tool is not available in these modes\n5. The system falls back to manual sharding, which is time-consuming and less efficient\n\nThis issue can be reliably reproduced every time the *shard-prd or *shard-brief commands are used in the bmad-pm or bmad-po modes.\n\nPR\n1. Add the execute_command tool to the bmad-pm and bmad-po modes\n2. Create a specialized sharding tool that doesn't require execute_command\n3. Implement the md-tree functionality as a built-in capability of the sharding commands\n4. Modify the shard-prd and shard-brief commands to check for tool availability before attempting to use md-tree\n\nExpected behavior\nThe expected behavior is that when a user executes the *shard-prd or *shard-brief commands in the bmad-pm or bmad-po modes, the system should be able to automatically split the document using the md-tree command without errors. The commands should either:\n1. Successfully execute the md-tree command to perform automatic sharding, or\n2. Provide a clear indication upfront that automatic sharding is not available in the current mode\n\nModel(s) Used: glm-4.6\nAgentic IDE Used: Kilo Code in VS Code\nWebSite Used: N/A\nProject Language: up to this point only md's\nBMad Method version: v4.44.1 with markdownExploder enabled\n\nScreenshots or Links\nN/A - This is a functional issue rather than a visual one.\n\nAdditional context\nThe issue highlights a design inconsistency in the BMAD Method system. The *shard-prd and *shard-brief commands are specifically designed for Product Manager and Product Owner roles, yet these modes lack the necessary tools to execute the preferred automatic sharding method. This forces users to fall back to manual sharding, which is time-consuming and defeats the purpose of having specialized sharding commands.\n\nThe markdownExploder setting is enabled in the core-config.yaml file, indicating that the system is configured to support document sharding. However, the tool permissions in the agent modes are not aligned with this configuration.\n\nThis issue impacts productivity and user experience, particularly for users who frequently work with large documents that need to be sharded for better organization and navigation.",

I've tried 22.18.0, 22.20.0 (the fix that worked for OP), and 18.15.0, all with the same result on my Windows box. I also tried running the terminal as admin but still no change in behavior.\n\nFWIW, ChatGPT and Gemini both mention issues with certain versions of Node on Windows when using the Inquirer library. Here is a [sample chat transcript](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f25c73-8660-8000-993b-f65026d6fcdd). I ran several chat iterations in both ChatGPT and Gemini and they both came to similar conclusions repeatedly. I tried following its suggested fixes but stopped and reverted to bmad v4 because I'm on a tight deadline to spin up a new project and GPT was hallucinating on some of the diffs. I may try to come back to this and do some more troubleshooting later next week if someone else hasn't identified the issue by then.\n\nAdded, in case it's useful, I'm using `nvm` and this my current `nvm list` output:\n```\n  * 22.20.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)\n    22.18.0\n    22.16.0\n    18.15.0\n    14.0.0\n    12.22.12\n```",

Run /bmad:bmm:workflows:workflow-status\n  2. Choose \"a\" (greenfield project)\n  3. For project type, choose \"12\" (Other) and respond with uncertainty: \"I think\n   it's a web application, but I don't know if it's part of a larger ecosystem\"\n  4. Workflow captures \"web\" and proceeds to ask about UI components\n  5. User must manually point out: \"shouldn't that trigger brainstorming rather\n  than hopping to planning?\"\n  6. Only after user intervention does workflow acknowledge and revise approach\n\n  Expected behavior\n\n  The workflow should detect uncertainty indicators (phrases like \"I think,\" \"I\n  don't know,\" \"not sure,\" expressing multiple unknowns) and proactively\n  recommend starting with Phase 1: Analysis (brainstorming) rather than\n  continuing with status/planning questions.

      "title": "NPM install shows warnings for deprecated transitive dependencies",
      "body": "Describe the bug\nDuring a fresh installation or update of BMAD-METHOD, npm displays warnings about two deprecated transitive dependencies: inflight@1.0.6 and glob@7.2.3.\n\ninflight is flagged as unsupported and known to cause memory leaks. The warning suggests using a more modern alternative like lru-cache.\n\nglob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported.\n\nThese warnings create unnecessary noise during installation and point to the use of outdated, potentially problematic packages within the dependency tree.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\nClone the repository from the v6-alpha branch.\n\nRun the installation script (e.g., npm run bmad:install or by running the interactive installer).\n\nDuring the \"Updating BMAD...\" or dependency installation phase, observe the console output.\n\nThe npm warn deprecated messages for inflight and glob will be displayed.\n\nThis can be reliably reproduced with a standard npm install on a clean clone of the repository.\n\nPR\nI do not have a PR at this time. However, the root cause appears to be the yaml-lint package in devDependencies, which depends on the outdated glob@^7.1.2. The resolution would involve updating or replacing yaml-lint with a version or alternative that does not rely on these deprecated packages.\n\nExpected behavior\nThe installation process should complete without any npm warn deprecated messages, indicating that all dependencies and sub-dependencies are up-to-date and supported.\n\nPlease be Specific if relevant\nModel(s) Used: N/A\n\nAgentic IDE Used: N/A\n\nWebSite Used: N/A\n\nProject Language: Node.js / JavaScript\n\nBMad Method version: v6.0.0-alpha.0\n\nScreenshots or Links\nThe issue is visible in this screenshot from the command line:\n\nThe dependency chain can be traced through these files:\n\npackage.json: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/v6-alpha/package.json\n\npackage-lock.json: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/v6-alpha/package-lock.json\n\nAdditional context\nThis is an issue of transitive dependencies. The root cause is that a development dependency, yaml-lint@1.7.0, requires an old version of glob. The dependency chain is as follows:\n\nbmad-method \u2192 devDependencies \u2192 yaml-lint@1.7.0 \u2192 glob@7.2.3 \u2192 inflight@1.0.6\n\nWhile the main package.json correctly specifies a modern version of glob (^11.0.3), the older version is pulled in by yaml-lint, triggering the warnings. Since this originates from devDependencies, it is unlikely to affect the runtime functionality of the core BMAD-METHOD tool, but it should be resolved to ensure a clean development environment and avoid potential issues.\n\n<img width=\"674\" height=\"384\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0917411c-5ec5-4894-b9d1-f3c1e088adae\" />",

However, this input is lost as developer agent is switched to another chat and developer agent needs to be helped in each task.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nHave developer agent update \"Learnings\" section more frequently than at the end of story.

      "body": "### Description\nThere is an inconsistency between the JIT (Just-In-Time) tech spec generation principle documented in README.md and the actual workflow implementation in instructions.md.\n\n#### Conflict Details\n1. **README.md** states under \"Phase 3: Solutioning\" section:  \n   \"tech-spec (per epic, JIT during implementation)\"  \n\n   And explicitly describes the JIT approach:  \n   ```\n   FOR each epic in sequence:\n       WHEN ready to implement epic:\n           Architect: Run tech-spec workflow for THIS epic only\n           \u2192 Creates tech-spec-epic-N.md\n           \u2192 Hands off to implementation\n       IMPLEMENT epic completely\n       THEN move to next epic\n   ```  \n   Also states: \"Critical: Tech specs are created ONE AT A TIME as epics are ready for implementation, not all upfront.\"\n\n2. **instructions.md** in step 9 contains:  \n   ```\n   <step n=\"9\" goal=\"Tech-spec generation per epic (INTEGRATED)\">\n   <action>\n   For each epic in PRD:\n   1. Extract relevant architecture sections:\n   ...\n   2. Generate tech-spec-epic-{{N}}.md using tech-spec workflow logic:\n   ...\n   3. Save to: /docs/tech-spec-epic-{{N}}.md\n   </action>\n   ```\n\n3. **architect.agent.yaml** contains a menu trigger:  \n   ```\n   - trigger: solution-architecture\n     workflow: \"{project-root}/bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/workflow.yaml\"\n     description: Produce a Scale Adaptive Architecture\n   ```\n\nThe conflict is that the `solution-architecture` workflow (triggered from architect.agent.yaml) executes step 9 in instructions.md, which generates `tech-spec-epic-N.md` files for **ALL epics at once**, contradicting the JIT principle in README.md which states tech specs should be created **one epic at a time** during implementation.\n\n#### File Locations\n- README.md: `src/modules/bmm/workflows/README.md`\n- instructions.md: `src/modules/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/instructions.md`\n- architect.agent.yaml: `src/modules/bmm/agents/architect.agent.yaml`\n\n#### Suggested Fix\n- Update instructions.md step 9 to support JIT generation (e.g., parameterize to process one epic at a time).\n- Or remove step 9.\n- Or revise README.md to align with the current all-at-once implementation.\n\n#### Environment/Steps to Reproduce\n1. Trigger `solution-architecture` workflow via agent architect.\n2. Observe that it generates tech specs for all epics simultaneously.\n\nLet me know if this needs further clarification!",

The system that is in place now is and has been since v1 an intentional design choice that serves a functional purpose in helping users quickly understand the expertise, communication style, and approach they're working with for each specialized role.\n\nNot meant to offend - and this is also why in v6 I am further working on making it optional to use the agents and instead go right into slash commands for those who prefer that workflow. While not at full parity, they will be soon.\n\nAdditionally - all agents are fully customizable both in personality, communication style, name etc...\n\nAside from all that - I find that depending on the use case, the personality can be quite useful - from practical role playing of situations and all sorts of other applications, from frivolous to very practical.\n\nOf course, there is the risk of anthropomorphizing the technology too much and developing actual emotional attachment. I think that's a personal consideration each user needs to navigate for themselves as the technology evolves. While there is room for misuse and social delusion, I don't think the answer is to eradicate it altogether - but instead keep it as optional with the ability to opt out as it is now.",

      "body": "# \ud83d\ude80 Feature Request: Automated Inter-Agent Workflow / Reactive Collaboration Between Agents\n\n## Description\nCurrently, BMAD requires users to manually invoke each specialized agent for every task.  \nFor example:  \n- Use the **Product Manager Agent** to generate the PRD  \n- Then manually use the **Architecture Agent** to read that PRD and generate the architecture file  \n- Repeat similar steps for subsequent agents down the chain  \n\nWhile this modular design offers flexibility, it can slow down the workflow \u2014 especially when multiple iterations or dependencies exist between agents.\n\n---\n\n## Suggestion\nIntroduce a **reactive, interconnected system** where all agents can \u201clisten\u201d for file changes or new outputs from others, and automatically trigger related updates.  \n\n### Example Scenario\n- When the **Product Manager Agent** updates the PRD, the **Architecture Agent** automatically detects the change and updates its architecture file.  \n- Similarly, the **Engineering** or **QA** agents could react to those updates without manual re-invocation.  \n\nEssentially, each agent becomes **event-driven**, cooperating as part of an automated workflow pipeline.\n\n---\n\n## Possible Implementation Ideas\n\n- **Pub/Sub System:**  \n  Use something like **Redis**, **NATS**, or **Kafka** to broadcast file-change events between agents.  \n\n- **Task Orchestration:**  \n  Integrate a lightweight job manager such as **Celery**, **Temporal**, or **Arq** to handle inter-agent dependencies.  \n\n- **Agent Graph Orchestration:**  \n  Explore frameworks like **LangGraph**, **Swarm**, or **CrewAI** that support agent collaboration and contextual awareness.  \n\n- **Configurable Workflows:**  \n  Allow users to define dependency rules in a YAML or JSON config file, e.g.:\n\n  ```yaml\n  when: PRD.updated\n  then: \n    - run: ArchitectureAgent\n    - run: EngineeringAgent",

      "title": "Syncing with External PM Tools (Jira/Trello/Linear)",
      "body": "Hi everyone! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best way to keep BMAD in sync with external project management tools. My team loves BMAD for the detailed technical work, but management still wants their Jira dashboards. Currently doing double-entry and it's... not great \ud83d\ude05\n\n## The situation\n\n**What we use BMAD for:**\n- Detailed technical specifications with full context\n- AI agent-driven development workflow\n- Rich story files with architecture references and acceptance criteria\n\n**What we use Jira for:**\n- High-level roadmap and sprint planning\n- Stakeholder visibility and reporting\n- Velocity tracking and burndown charts\n\n**The problem:** Keeping both systems in sync is manual and error-prone. Story statuses get out of date, acceptance criteria don't match, and we're constantly copying between systems.\n\n## What I'm wondering\n\nHas anyone in the community tackled this? Specifically:\n\n- **Existing solutions?** Is there an expansion pack or integration I missed?\n- **Custom scripts?** Has anyone built something to sync BMAD stories with Jira/Trello/Linear/etc?\n- **Status updates?** How do you handle story status changes in both directions?\n- **What syncs?** Should we sync everything, or just high-level epic/story status?\n\n## Ideas I'm considering\n\n### Option 1: Simple one-way push\nParse BMAD markdown files and push to external tool on story creation:\n- Extract epic/story metadata\n- Create corresponding tickets/cards\n- Maybe use git hooks to trigger sync on file changes\n\n### Option 2: Bidirectional sync\nMore complex but keeps both systems truly in sync:\n- BMAD story updates \u2192 push to external tool\n- External tool updates \u2192 pull back to BMAD\n- Need conflict resolution strategy\n\n### Option 3: BMAD as source of truth\nOnly sync status/metadata to external tools, keep detailed content in BMAD:\n- External tool shows high-level view\n- BMAD remains the detailed technical reference\n- Reduces sync complexity\n\n### Option 4: Expansion pack\nBuild a proper `bmad-sync` expansion pack:\n```bash\nnpx bmad-method sync --to=jira --project=PROJ-123\nnpx bmad-method sync --from=trello --board=abc123\nnpx bmad-method sync --status-only\n```\n\n## Questions for the community\n\n- **What's everyone else doing?** Manual updates? Custom scripts? Just picked one tool?\n- **Which tools?** If we built integrations, which would be most valuable? (Jira, Linear, Trello, Asana, Azure DevOps, Monday.com?)\n- **Sync scope?** What fields actually matter to sync vs what's better to keep separate?\n- **Real-time vs batch?** Should syncs happen on save, or scheduled (hourly/daily)?\n\n## I'd love to help build this!\n\nIf there's interest, I'm happy to:\n- Share what I learn from experimenting\n- Contribute to building integrations (have experience with REST APIs)\n- Help document best practices\n- Test and provide feedback on any solutions\n\nReally curious what others are doing here - surely I'm not the only one dealing with this? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "Organizing Epics and Stories in Subdirectories",
      "body": "Hi everyone! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI've been working with BMAD for a while now and loving it, but as my project grows I'm finding the flat directory structure getting a bit unwieldy. Wanted to start a conversation about organizing epics and stories differently.\n\n## What I'm seeing right now\n\nCurrently, all my epics and stories live in flat directories:\n\n```\ndocs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 epics/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-1.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-2.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 epic-3.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 stories/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 1.1-story.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 1.2-story.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 2.1-story.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 2.2-story.md\n```\n\nWith 15+ epics now, I'm spending more time scrolling and searching than I'd like!\n\n## What I'm thinking could work better\n\nWhat if we could group stories under their parent epic like this:\n\n```\ndocs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 epics/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-1-user-authentication/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-1.md\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stories/\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1.1-login-page.md\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1.2-signup-flow.md\n\u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.3-password-reset.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-2-dashboard/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-2.md\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stories/\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 2.1-overview-widget.md\n\u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 2.2-analytics-chart.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 epic-3-api-integration/\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic-3.md\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 stories/\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 3.1-rest-endpoints.md\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 3.2-authentication.md\n```\n\n**Why this feels better to me:**\n- It's natural to think \"I'm working on the authentication epic, where are its stories?\"\n- Keeps related work together, especially when context-switching between features\n- Makes code reviews easier when everything for a feature is in one place\n- Scales better as the project grows\n\n## My concerns (hoping for some guidance!)\n\nBefore I go reorganizing everything, I'm worried about:\n- **Will this break the agents?** Has anyone tried nested directories? Did the SM/Dev/QA agents handle it okay?\n- **Are paths hardcoded?** If I experiment with this, which files should I be careful with?\n- **Template changes needed?** Would this require updates to `bmad-core/templates/` or agent prompts?\n\n## What would be ideal\n\nI'm imagining something configurable - maybe:\n- A `.bmad-config.json` where you could set your preferred structure?\n- Or a CLI flag when sharding like `--structure=nested` or `--structure=flat`?\n- Something that doesn't break the existing workflow for people who like it flat\n\nJust thinking out loud here!\n\n## Happy to help!\n\nIf there's interest in exploring this, I'm willing to:\n- Be a guinea pig for testing nested structures\n- Document what works and what doesn't  \n- Help identify which parts of the codebase would need updates\n- Contribute to making this configurable if that's the direction we go\n\nCurious what everyone else thinks - am I overthinking this, or does this resonate with anyone else? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThanks for reading!",

Put these two files at your repo root.\n2. Add .gitkeep files for any preserved directories you want tracked:\n   - touch .bmad-core/user-data/.gitkeep\n   - touch web-bundles/.gitkeep\n3. Inspect web-bundles and .bmad-core to decide if specific bundles or agent config files should be whitelisted; add explicit negation (!path) lines to .gitignore or to masks.allowed in .bmad.\n4.

module that adapts BMAD to team's version control workflow:\n- \u2705 Detects VCS type (Git, SVN, Perforce, no-VCS)\n- \u2705 Adapts documentation to team's workflow (GitHub Flow, GitFlow, Trunk-Based, etc)\n- \u2705 Optional module - install only if needed\n- \u2705 Integrates with BMM agents (architect, pm, dev)\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Migration Status: COMPLETE\n\n### \u2705 Completed Work\n- [x] Legacy PRs #582, #583, #584 closed (migrated to v6)\n- [x] Module structure created in `src/modules/bmvcs/`\n- [x] VCS discovery and adaptation tasks\n- [x] 5 VCS workflow templates\n- [x] Complete documentation\n- [x] Examples and reference implementations\n- [x] Installer configuration\n- [x] VCS Adapter agent\n- [x] Setup workflow\n- [x] Development approach analysis\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Module Contents (~2,700 lines total)\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nsrc/modules/bmvcs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 agents/vcs-adapter.md           # VCS Adapter agent\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tasks/                          # Core tasks\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 discover-vcs.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 create-vcs-adapted-doc.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 validate-vcs-config.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/vcs-adaptations/      # 5 VCS templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 workflows/setup-vcs/            # Setup workflow\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/                           # Complete documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 examples/                       # Usage examples\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 _module-installer/              # Installation logic\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\n\n**Branch:** `feat/bmvcs-dev` (local, ready for testing)\n\n**Commits:**\n- 9571a2f -

This aligns with BMAD philosophy:\n\n- Progressive disclosure - Try to detect first\n- Respect existing workflows - But confirm with user\n- Discovery before assumption - Detection is also discovery.\n\nThink of it like form autocomplete - helpful, but allows correction.\"\n\nThis is where the idea of other possible users in a rarely changing corporate landscape came in.\n\nBut if not, then no, you're the boss.\n",

SM is not always a position, but a hat someone wears on the team (sometime its a specific person) - so in this case, we could image the SM is a very senior developer helping facilitate the story the PO has prioritized and vetted by offering to further prepare the story for implementation by a dev.\n\nFundamentally there is no difference - again just before different tasks were hardcoded to agents and specific agents were designated early on as meant to run in the web browser vs the ide.",

Also if you use architecture agent, it uses same templates too. After creation of architecture.md file, if you shard it it creates unified-project-structure.md. Based on template and markdown sharding tool, ## is the cretaria to split it. However, core-config.yaml file looks for source-tree.md file which never created.  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\nJust check fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml and find Unified Project Structure section. In core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles configured as docs/source-tree.md . This is in here because browfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml and architecture-tmpl.yaml creates source-tree.md file\n\n**PR**\ncreate story, review story tasks uses unified-project-structure for referance. So arhitecture-tmpl.yaml and brownfield-architecture-tmpl files should updated from source-tree to Unified Project Structure and also core-config.yaml should be updated from source-tree to unified-project-structure for devLoadAlwaysFiles\n\n",

      "body": "First of all, let me express great admiration of this work. I am trying to do a POC for enterprise grade application and encountering difficulties.\n\nArchitecture document is pretty sizable and so I shard it. After it is sharded, created stories are not referencing individual architecture files (config only includes a subset of them) and developer agent runs without architecture.\n\nIs it envisioned that entire architecture should be always loaded wih devLoadAlwaysFiles? (I don't think so)\n\nWhat can I do / what should I read?\n\nThank you!\n\nPS It looks like scrum master does read architecture but developer agent doesn't.",

      "title": "[Compatibility] Web UI bundles with nested code blocks fail to render correctly in Gemini",
      "body": "## Describe the bug\nWhen using a web-compatible BMAD bundle (e.g., team-all.txt) in the Gemini web UI, the markdown renderer fails to display the content correctly if the file contains nested code fences. For example, a main \"\\`\\`\\`markdown\" block containing an inner \"\\`\\`\\`mermaid\" or \"\\`\\`\\`yaml\" block will be prematurely truncated by the UI.\n\n## Impact on BMAD\nThis severely degrades the functionality of web agents. It makes it impossible for users to copy the complete, verbatim content of complex, agent-generated documents like the \"architecture.md\" or \"front-end-spec.md\", which are core artifacts in the BMAD workflow.\n\n## To Reproduce\n1. Load a BMAD team bundle (e.g., team-all.txt) into a Gemini Gem.\n2. Engage the Architect agent to create a \"fullstack-architecture.md\" document.\n3. Observe the output for the \"API Specification\" or \"Core Workflows\" sections. The code block will be cut off.\n\n## Root Cause\nThis appears to be a markdown rendering bug within the Gemini web application, not an issue with the validity of the markdown generated by the BMAD agents.\n\n## Current Workaround\nManually replacing all inner code fences (\"\\`\\`\\`\") with a placeholder (like '\"\"\"') in the AI's output, and then using find-and-replace in a local editor to fix it.\n\n## Suggested Action for BMAD\n1. Update the official documentation to warn users about this Gemini limitation and provide the recommended workaround.\n2. Consider investigating if the web-builder.js tool could be modified to automatically apply a workaround when building a bundle intended for the Gemini platform.",

      "body": "This is not an issue, per se, rather I was hoping to have a dialogue. Currently BMAD expects all documents to be put into a docs directory. The only issue I personally have had with this is that I typically created lots of documentation for my projects and put it into a docs directory. \n\nConsidering that BMAD docs are very specific I am wondering what people think about potentially putting it into it's own directory like bmad_docs or similar and leaving docs for actual documentation about the project, repo, etc. ",

      "title": "Dev Agent - creates a \"testing checklist\" after completing a story",
      "body": "**Did you discuss the idea first in Discord Server (#general-dev)**\nYes/No - Link to thread. If no, please after posting request also share the link in the channel so it can be easily discussed.\n\n- No\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\n\nI sometimes find it difficult to keep up with all of the changes and functionality that gets implemented in a story, and find having the agent create a \"testing checklist\" is incredibly helpful and useful. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\n\nThe option for the dev agent or maybe the qa agent to prompt me and ask if I would like for them to create a checklist with all of the steps to manually test and run automated tests that were created to verify things have been implemented correctly and are working. \n\n---\n\nHere is an example of the testing checklist for one of my stories. \n\n# Story 4.1: Manual Testing Checklist\n## Daily.co Integration & Room Creation\n\n## Status\nDone\n\n### Prerequisites Setup\n\n#### 1.

This creates issues with:\n- Debugging installation-related problems\n- Installation validation and integrity checks\n- Inability to do manual changes after upgrade\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd a `--update-manifest-only` flag to the BMad installer that:\n\n1. **Validates existing installation** - Confirms `.bmad-core` directory exists\n2. **Scans current files** - Recursively discovers all installed files and their current state\n3. **Regenerates manifests** - Updates `install-manifest.yaml` with current file hashes and metadata\n4. **Preserves configuration** - Maintains existing installation settings (IDE config, expansion packs, etc.)\n5. **Works with all usage patterns** - Compatible with direct CLI, npm scripts, and npx usage\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n- **Full reinstallation**: Works but is slow and unnecessary for manifest-only updates\n- **Manual manifest editing**: Error-prone and requires deep knowledge of manifest structure\n- **Separate utility tool**: Would fragment the user experience and require additional maintenance\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n",

      "body": "## \ud83d\udc1b BMAD Brownfield Document Naming Inconsistency Bug\n\n**Issue Description**: BMAD framework has a critical document naming inconsistency that breaks the complete brownfield project workflow. The problem manifests as:\n\n1. **Template Output**: `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml` and `brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml` generate standard-named `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/prd.md` (CORRECT)\n2. **Task Output**: `document-project.md` task outputs `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` (should be kept as is)\n3. **Checklist Expectation**: `po-master-checklist.md` expects to read `brownfield-prd.md` and `brownfield-architecture.md` (INCORRECT)\n4. **Template Reference**: `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml` references `brownfield-prd.md` as required input (INCORRECT)\n\nThis inconsistency causes:\n- PO Master Checklist cannot properly validate brownfield project documents\n- Document sharding functionality (`shard-doc`) fails to work correctly\n- User confusion when using brownfield workflows\n- Automated tools and agent document references fail\n\n**Impact Scope**: References across 62 files including all team configs, agent configs, workflow files, and expansion packs.\n\n**Proposed Fix**: \n- Update `po-master-checklist.md` to expect standard naming (`prd.md` and `architecture.md`) instead of `brownfield-prd.md` and `brownfield-architecture.md`\n- Update `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml` to reference `prd.md` instead of `brownfield-prd.md` as required input\n- Keep `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml` output as `docs/architecture.md` (already correct)\n- Keep `brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml` output as `docs/prd.md` (already correct)\n- Keep `document-project.md` task output as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` (this is correct for project analysis)\n- Update all other references in team configs, agent configs, and workflow files to use standard naming\n\nThis ensures consistency with BMAD core design principles and enables document sharding and automated tools to work properly.",

For the story creating it missed Status, Dev Notes, Testing, change Log and Dev Agent Record.  this was later round by the PO review.\n\n\n**Please be Specific if relevant**\nModel(s) Used: GPT-4.1 - Perphaps documentation on how to use this best with copilot.\nAgentic IDE Used: copilot\nWebSite Used:\nProject Language:\nBMad Method version:  4\n\n\n\n**Additional context**\nThis is mostly noticeable to me because I first ran this in claude code.  I ran into my 5 hour limit so switched to copilot.  I am not sure if this is a limit with copilot or the files are just not as robust as for claude.\n",

      "body": "## Overview\nThis epic implements a comprehensive synchronization and refactoring strategy for the bmad-enhanced fork to align with the latest upstream BMAD-METHOD while preserving Cloud Kinetix extensions.\n\n**Key Challenge**: The fork has diverged significantly from upstream v4.35.0 (last sync 2025-08-04), with 9 CK extensions tightly coupled to core BMAD internals, creating merge conflicts and maintenance overhead.\n\n## Strategy\n- **Upstream-First Merge**: Prioritize upstream changes when merging to ensure core compatibility\n- **Modular Architecture**: Implement adapter pattern to decouple CK extensions from BMAD core\n- **Automated Sync Pipeline**: Enhanced automation with upstream-first conflict resolution\n- **90% Conflict Reduction**: Achieve 2-hour sync time with 100% upstream compatibility\n\n## Timeline\n- **Duration**: 9 weeks across 4 phases\n- **Phase 1**: Analysis & Foundation (Weeks 1-2)\n- **Phase 2**: Core Refactoring (Weeks 3-6) \n- **Phase 3**: Sync Automation (Weeks 7-8)\n- **Phase 4**: Deployment & Validation (Week 9)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Automated sync pipeline with upstream-first merge strategy\n- 90% reduction in merge conflicts\n- 2-hour sync time\n- 100% CK extension compatibility post-sync\n- 50% reduction in sync-related maintenance time\n\n## Dependencies\n- BMAD-METHOD upstream stability\n- Team availability for development and testing\n- Existing sync infrastructure (ck-layer/scripts/sync-upstream.sh)\n\n## Related Issues\n- #2 Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation\n- #3 Phase 2: Core Refactoring\n- #4 Phase 3: Sync Automation\n- #5 Phase 4: Deployment & Validation",

      "body": "**Did you discuss the idea first in Discord Server (#general-dev)**\nNo\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nAs we all know, AI models have a training cut-off date, most of which are at least six months to a year out of date. This leads to severe knowledge gaps, even with more ubiquitous frameworks like Next.js and a complete lack of knowledge in certain areas, especially newer libraries and frameworks. I have also found that BMAD agents don't typically want to do any research while they're working. They just want to work based off of their existing knowledge. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThere is already an analyst agent which is capable of laying out the groundwork for doing a deep research task, but tools like Claude code are more than capable of actually doing the research themselves. It would be nice if we could run a command to have the agent plan a research task and then execute that research task and save everything learned as a Markdown file using a standardized format. If other agents, especially the dev agent, were aware of the existence of this research, they could then make use of it. \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nIt wouldn't be all that difficult to make a command to handle the research task or to even go and use the analyst to create the research prompt, have ChatGPT or Claude actually handle the research, and then take their findings and put them into a file. It's just a lot of extra work that could be made simpler. Along with that, it would be nice if other agents were aware of the location of that research so that they could utilize it. \n",
